# Auth0 Docs Authoring Skill

**Scope:** This skill applies ONLY to the Auth0 docs-v2 repository.

Use this skill when actively authoring new public Auth0 product documentation or fixing style violations in this repository to ensure content aligns with the Auth0 Docs Style Guide.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

**Do NOT load for:**
- Reading existing docs to understand Auth0 features or APIs
- Searching docs for information
- General discussion about documentation content
- Code implementation (even if docs-related)
- Navigating or exploring the docs repository

**Only load when actively authoring or correcting documentation style/structure.**

## Workflow

**Before drafting:**
- Choose doc type (concept/guide/reference) and title accordingly
- Plan headings for scannability, focus on one primary topic
- Note required terminology and compliance constraints

**While writing:**
- Voice/tone: Clear, approachable, user-focused
- Grammar: Present tense, active voice, imperative mood for instructions
- Headings: Sentence case (not title case)
- Language: Inclusive, accessible, avoid idioms/jargon
- Terminology: Use Word Lists for Auth0 features, capitalization
- Formatting: Follow rules for links, images, alt text, code blocks

**For translation readiness:**
- Short, unambiguous sentences
- Avoid and/or, (s) plurals, idiomatic phrasal verbs
- Define abbreviations on first use
- Reuse existing phrasing for translation memory

**For compliance/regulatory:**
- Legal/Security/Compliance teams are source of truth
- Follow structure for Early Access, Beta, deprecation notices
- Include required dates, replacement features, migration links

**When in doubt:** Prefer the most specific reference (Word Lists for terminology, Writing for Translation for international readers, Other Conventions for UI text/links). Apply guidance concisely without quoting verbatim.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Title case for headings | Use sentence case (only first word capitalized) |
| Warning for Enterprise plan restrictions | Use Callout with `icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9"` |
| Placeholder format `{{VAR}}` | Use `YOUR_SOMETHING` or `<something-id>` conventions |
| Passive voice in instructions | Use active voice and imperative mood |
| Using and/or or (s) for plurals | Write out both options or rephrase for clarity |
| Generic "click here" links | Use descriptive link text |
| Missing alt text for images | Provide specific, descriptive alt text |
