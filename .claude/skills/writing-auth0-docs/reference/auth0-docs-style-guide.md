# Auth0 Docs Style Guide

### Overview

This style guide covers terminology and content specific to Auth0, along with some comments on common writing issues. It is a house style guide, not a complete set of writing guidelines or a statement that our decisions are objectively correct.

Like most style guides, our style guide aims to improve the consistency of our documentation, but this guide is a living document, so it changes over time. When it changes, we may not always change previously published documentation to match. When in doubt, follow this guide rather than imitating existing, potentially outdated documents.

Some of these guidelines are adapted and remixed from Google's Developer Documentation Style Guide and Microsoft Writing Style Guide, per Creative Commons License.

## Style standards

In general, we use American English according to the standards described in the Associated Press's (AP) Stylebook. For general software-industry styles and terminology, refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

That said, we'd rather you submit good information that doesn't conform to this guide than no information at all. Auth0’s technical writers are always happy to help you with stylistic concerns—without judgement.

## Accessibility and inclusivity

We write our documentation with accessibility and inclusivity in mind. Many of the choices we have documented in this guide were made with the intent of meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements. In addition, we use inclusive language throughout our docs to ensure our documentation is accessible and welcoming to all readers.
