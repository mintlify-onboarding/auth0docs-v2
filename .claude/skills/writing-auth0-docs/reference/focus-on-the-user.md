# Focus on the User

We take a user-centered approach to creating content, which focuses on the impact we want to have on our audience's behavior.

### Voice and tone

We prefer a voice and tone that is natural, approachable, and respectful without being overly informal or whimsical. Avoid writing exactly the way you speak—you probably speak less concisely and more colloquially than you should write—but aim for a conversational, human tone.

Remember that many readers are not native English speakers, that they come from many different cultures, and that your document may be translated into other languages. Use clear, precise language, short sentences, and brief three-to-five sentence paragraphs. When discussing complex or formal concepts, follow them with an explanation.

In general, remember to put the user first; what matters most is what readers can do with our technology for their users.

## Scannability

To make your documentation easy to read:
- Keep your documents short: five minutes reading time per page (about 6,000 words) is ideal. Documents should be no longer than 10 minutes reading time (about 12,000 words).
- Introduce links between documents, for instance a "Getting Started Guide" and a "Production Readiness Guide" or "Core Concepts" and "Deep Dives".

## Findability

Your documentation is not useful if it cannot be found and if it will not be read. To make your documentation easy to find:
- Use page titles and URLs that include keywords a developer would search for.
- Include the programming languages and APIs that are being used and explained in the page title and include the action that will be performed.
- Many search engines cut titles off after 60 characters, so keep titles shorter by leaving off "how to".
- Restrict your documentation to one topic per page. As developers are searching for specific topics, search engines will rank pages higher that are all about that one topic, not multiple things at once.
