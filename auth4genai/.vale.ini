; Vale configuration for Mintlify docs.
; Mintlify CI will pick this up if enabled:
; https://www.mintlify.com/docs/deploy/ci
;
; Keep this file under version control and evolve it with the docs:
; https://www.mintlify.com/guides/maintenance
;
; Vale config reference:
; https://vale.sh/docs
;
; MDX support:
; - Vale 3.13+ treats .mdx as a first class format.
; - MDX parsing is handled by the external mdx2vast CLI, which must be
;   installed and available on $PATH:
;     npm install -g mdx2vast
;
; When Vale flags something that is actually OK:
; - If it is project-wide (for example a product name), add it to:
;     .vale/styles/config/ignore/authdocs.txt
; - If it is a systematic branding issue, add a swap to:
;     .vale/styles/AuthDocs/Brands.yml
; - Only use {/* vale off */} / {/* vale on */} for
;   narrow, one-off cases (quotes, unusual examples).

; Only report error-level issues. Suggestions and warnings are suppressed
; entirely so devs are not blocked on minor style nits.

; Scopes to ignore completely. These are either:
; - Already covered by other tooling, or
; - Places where language checks are too noisy or fragile
;   (inline code, URLs, links, images).
; Note: 'code' is handled by SkippedScopes below for block-level code.

; Skip entire blocks that are not prose. This keeps Vale out of
; style/script tags, <pre> blocks, code fences, and figures.

; Replace the built-in spelling rule with a custom one that knows about our
