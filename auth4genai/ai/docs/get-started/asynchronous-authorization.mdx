Auth for GenAI enables AI agents to asynchronously authorize users using the [Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow (CIBA)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow). AI agents can work in the background, only notifying the user when needed for critical actions.

When you add secure [human-in-the-loop approvals](https://sdk.vercel.ai/cookbook/next/human-in-the-loop) to your AI agent workflows, you can use Auth0 to request the user's permission to complete an authorization request. The AI agent can render [rich authorization data](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-flow/user-authorization-with-ciba) in the consent prompt so the user knows exactly what they're authorizing.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an AI agent integrated with the [Auth0 AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js) that can request to buy products from an online shop on the user's behalf.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have completed the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Auth0 Account and a Dev Tenant">
    To continue with this quickstart, you need an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup?onboard_app=genai&ocid=7014z000001NyoxAAC-aPA4z0000008OZeGAM) and a Developer Tenant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Auth0 Application">
    [Create and configure an Auth0 Application](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) with the following properties:
    - Type: `Regular Web`
    - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
    - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`

    To learn more about Auth0 applications, read [Applications](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable CIBA Grant">
    Enable the Token Exchange Grant for your Auth0 Application. Go to **Applications > [Your Application] > Settings > Advanced > Grant Types** and enable the **Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)** grant type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Guardian Push">
    Enable Mutli-factor authentication (MFA) with Guardian Push Notifications for your Auth0 tenant.

    To learn more about MFA with Guardian, read the [Auth0 Guardian documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/auth0-guardian).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enroll your user to use Auth0 Guardian">
    To initiate a CIBA push request, the authorizing user must be enrolled in MFA using push notifications. To verify if the authorizing user is enrolled for MFA push notifications in the [Auth0 Dashboard](http://manage.auth0.com/), navigate to **User Management > Users** and click on the user.

    Under **Multi-Factor Authentication**, Auth0 lists the factors the user is enrolled in:

      <img src="/ai/docs/img/user_enrolled_in_auth0_guardian.png" alt="User Enrolled in Auth0 Guardian" />
    </Frame>

    If the user is not enrolled, you can send an enrollment request by email:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/ai/docs/img/enroll_user_in_auth0_guardian.png" alt="Enable Guardian Push Screenshot" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="OpenAI Platform">
    Set up an [OpenAI account and API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key).
  </Step>
</Steps>
