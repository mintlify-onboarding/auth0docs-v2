Use Auth0 SDKs to fetch access tokens for social and enterprise identity providers from Auth0's [Token Vault](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault). Using these access tokens, AI agents integrated with the application can call third-party APIs to perform tasks on the user's behalf.

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an AI application integrated with Auth0 that can:

1. Retrieve access tokens for a Google social connection.
2. Integrate with an AI agent to call Google APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have completed the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Auth0 Account and a Dev Tenant">
    To continue with this quickstart, you need an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup?onboard_app=genai&ocid=7014z000001NyoxAAC-aPA4z0000008OZeGAM) and a Developer Tenant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Auth0 Application">
    [Create and configure an Auth0 Application](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard) with the following properties:
    - Type: `Regular Web`
    - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
    - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`

    To learn more about Auth0 applications, read [Applications](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Token Exchange Grant">
    Enable the Token Exchange Grant for your Auth0 Application. Go to **Applications > [Your Application] > Settings > Advanced > Grant Types** and enable the **Token Exchange** grant type.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Google Social Connection">
    Set up a Google developer account that allows for third-party API calls following the [Google Sign-in and Authorization](/ai/docs/guides/google-sign-in-and-auth) instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="OpenAI Platform">
    Set up an [OpenAI account and API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key).
  </Step>
</Steps>
