The OpenID Connect (OIDC) connection allows you to integrate with any identity provider that supports the OpenID Connect standard, providing flexibility for custom integrations.

## Overview

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows your application to verify the identity of users and obtain basic profile information in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

To learn more and configure a custom OIDC connection with Auth0, see our [Connect to OpenID Connect Identity Provider documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/oidc).

## Configure Token Vault

After creating the connection, at the bottom of the connection settings in the **Advanced** section enable the **Enable Token Vault** toggle. This will allow your connection to retrieve and store access tokens for third-party APIs.
