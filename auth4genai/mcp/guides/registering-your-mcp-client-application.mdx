Auth0 provides mechanisms to issue unique client credentials and exposes standardized discovery endpoints for authorization. It supports the `resource` parameter on `/authorize` and related endpoints to issue tokens scoped to specific APIs or MCP Servers. Auth0 SDKs manage registration, discovery, and token exchange for secure MCP integration.

This pattern establishes trust between clients and APIs, limits access to approved agents, and provides secure, auditable registration for every MCP integration.

### Metadata Discovery

Metadata discovery is part of the authorization flow in MCP powered applications. During the authorization process, the MCP client will request the server metadata and the authorization server information if it exists. For details, see [MCP Authorization Flow with Auth0](/mcp/intro/user-authentication#mcp-authorization-flow-with-auth0).

Auth0 exposes the `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` document for automatic endpoint discovery ([RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)).

### Client Registration

After receiving metadata from the MCP server and authorization server, the MCP client can be registered either through static client registration or by performing Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

**Static client registration (recommended for production)**

[Manually create and configure the client in Auth0](/mcp/get-started/user-authentication#create-an-application-to-represent-your-mcp-client), issue credentials, and assign scopes for the MCP API. This provides stronger control, predictable client identifiers, and easier auditing.

```shell wrap lines
auth0 api post clients --data '{
  "name": "MCP Inspector",
  "app_type": "regular_web",
  "is_first_party": false,
  "callbacks": ["http://localhost:6274/oauth/callback"],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post",
  "oidc_conformant": true,
  "jwt_configuration": { "alg": "RS256" },
  "logo_uri": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/182288589"
}'
```

**Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**

Allows clients to register themselves dynamically. Auth0 supports [Open Dynamic Registration](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/dynamic-client-registration#enable-dynamic-client-registration), which means that if you enable this feature, anyone can create applications in your tenant without a token. Read **[Securing an Open DCR Endpoint](/mcp/guides/registering-your-mcp-client-application#securing-an-open-dcr-endpoint)** below for strategies to mitigate risk.

#### Securing an Open DCR Endpoint

Open Dynamic Client Registration (Open DCR) enables flexible MCP integrations but exposes your tenant to potential abuse if left unauthenticated. Without security controls, anyone can create applications in your tenant, potentially leading to resource exhaustion, unauthorized access attempts, or tenant misconfiguration.

There are two approaches you can implement to mitigate these risks:

* **[Tenant Access Control List (ACL)](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tenant-access-control-list)** (Recommended) - Restrict which IP address ranges or domains can access your tenant's DCR endpoints through Auth0's built-in ACL feature. This approach protects both your custom domain and canonical Auth0 hostname (e.g., `tenant.auth0.com`), providing comprehensive protection. It's ideal when you know the IP ranges of legitimate clients (such as your internal network or specific cloud providers) and want to enforce network-based access control without managing additional infrastructure.

* **[Reverse Proxy](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains/self-managed-certificates/configure-cloudflare-for-use-as-reverse-proxy)** - Place a reverse proxy (such as Cloudflare) in front of your custom domain to rate-limit, filter, and authenticate requests before they reach the DCR endpoint. This approach allows you to control request volume, implement custom authentication logic, and monitor traffic patterns. However, note that even with a reverse proxy on your custom domain, the DCR endpoint remains accessible via your canonical Auth0 hostname (e.g., `tenant.auth0.com`), which can bypass the proxy. For comprehensive protection, use this approach in combination with Tenant ACL.

Both approaches can be used together for defense-in-depth security. Regardless of which approach you choose, regularly monitor your [tenant logs](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs) to detect suspicious registration patterns, such as rapid application creation or registrations from unexpected sources.

## Authentication and Authorization for MCP Servers

When an MCP server is exposed to the internet, it must be secured. The MCP specification recommends using [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) to secure these interactions. This allows an MCP server to delegate authentication to a dedicated authorization server and manage access control for different clients, users, and actions using scopes.

### Mandatory Server Configuration

For a client to interact with your server, the MCP specification requires you to announce your authorization configuration and use standard HTTP responses.

1. **Use the `WWW-Authenticate` Header for 401 Errors**

   When a client makes a request without a valid token, your server must return a `401 Unauthorized` status. Crucially, this response must include the `WWW-Authenticate` header, pointing to the metadata URL you configured above. This signals to the client that authentication is required and tells it exactly.

2. **Announce Your Auth Server with Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))**

   Your MCP server must tell clients where to get authorized. To do this, you must expose a metadata endpoint. Create a `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint on your server that returns a JSON object pointing to your Auth0 tenant. This allows MCP clients to automatically discover your authorization endpoints without manual configuration.

## MCP Authorization flow with Auth0

With Auth0 your MCP servers can follow OAuth 2.1 features required by the Model Context Protocol specification. [Learn more](/mcp/intro/user-authentication#mcp-authorization-flow-with-auth0).
