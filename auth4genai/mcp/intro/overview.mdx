The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard for connecting AI applications to external data sources, tools, and workflows through a consistent interface. It lets agents use your SaaS apps and internal APIs, run organization-specific workflows, and reuse integrations instead of building one-offs.

Auth0's **Auth for MCP** lets developers securely and easily implement the authorization parts of the MCP spec with OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect. It provides sign in, standards based discovery and client registration, resource scoped tokens, and token exchange so you can control which agents connect, which resources they can access, and which actions they can perform.

### User Authentication

Require users to sign in before they or their AI agents connect to MCP servers. Auth0 Universal Login supports social, enterprise, and custom identity providers so users can sign in with existing credentials. Access tokens issued by Auth0 include identity details that MCP servers can validate on every request.

For enterprise environments, **Workforce Identity for MCP** integrates your MCP deployment with your organization’s identity provider using **Single Sign-On (SSO)**. Auth0 connects to Okta, Entra ID, Ping, Google Workspace, and other IdPs so employees authenticate with existing credentials before any MCP interaction begins.

### Metadata Discovery and Client Registration for MCP

Register MCP clients and servers using standards-aligned discovery and registration so agents connect only to approved resources. Auth0 validates client metadata, issues client credentials, and exposes the necessary discovery endpoints. This lets MCP clients find the right authorization server and request tokens without manual configuration.

### Call Your APIs on User’s Behalf

When an **AI agent** connects to your **MCP server**, the server may need to call your internal APIs to read data or trigger workflows. Those APIs need tokens that reflect who the user is and what the server is allowed to do.

**Auth0 Custom Token Exchange** enables that delegation. The MCP server exchanges the token it received from the client for a new, short-lived access token scoped to the internal API. This lets **MCP servers** call internal APIs on behalf of users while **Auth0** issues and governs access centrally.

### Call Third-Party APIs on User’s Behalf

MCP Servers often connect AI Agents to third-party services such as Google, Microsoft, Jira, or Notion. Auth0’s **Token Vault** handles these integrations by managing token issuance, storage, rotation, and revocation for external APIs. Token Vault eliminates manual credential handling and makes it easy to extend MCP connectivity across the modern SaaS ecosystem.

## Early Access

Auth for MCP delivers secure and scalable authentication and authorization for MCP servers using Auth0. It offers OAuth-compliant solutions for developers building applications that integrate AI agents. Key capabilities include:

* **Resource Parameter Compatibility Profile:** define resource servers, with a compatibility mode that automatically applies the `resource` parameter when the `audience` parameter is not provided.
* **Custom Token Exchange:** securely exchange tokens with internal APIs and configure token exchange profiles.
* **Token Vault:** easily access external APIs such as Google and Microsoft, and more.
