<Note>
  Auth for MCP is currently available in Early Access and it's available for Universal Login flows only.
</Note>

Auth0’s Universal Login supports social, enterprise, and custom identity providers so users can sign in with existing credentials. Every access token issued through Auth0 carries verified identity context, ensuring all MCP interactions start from a trusted source.

## Why authentication matters for MCP

* Secure and controlled access: Safeguards user data, manages who can use your MCP server and what they can do, and establishes a clear audit trail for activities performed through MCP servers and clients.
* Auditability: Provides a record of user activities for auditing and compliance.

## Authentication for users of MCP Servers

Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. With Auth0, your users can log in with:

- Username and password
- [Passwordless and Passkeys](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/passwordless)
- [Social Login (Google, Meta, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/passwordless#social-login)
- [Corporate credentials and Single Sign On (SSO)](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/single-sign-on) for B2B AI applications
- And more.

Auth0 also provides the following features for enhanced security and scalability:

- [Multi-factor Authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication)
- [Attack Protection](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection): Detect attacks and stop malicious attempts to access your application, such as blocking traffic from certain IPs and displaying CAPTCHA. This includes Bot Detection, Suspicious IP Throttling, Brute Force Protection, and Breached Password Detection.
- [Highly Regulated Identity](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/highly-regulated-identity)
- UI and login flow customizations via [Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions) and [Forms](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/forms)

## MCP Authorization flow with Auth0

Here is the standard OAuth authorization code flow when an MCP server uses Auth0 as its authorization server:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    The MCP client sends a request to the protected MCP server and receives HTTP `401 Unauthorized` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header that indicates the protected resource metadata URL.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The MCP client requests the [resource metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728/) from the MCP server at the `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The MCP client parses the metadata, selects an authorization server (Auth0) from the list, and then fetches its OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata from the `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` endpoint. [Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/dynamic-client-registration#enable-dynamic-client-registration) can happen after receiving the metadata response.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The client generates [PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) parameters and builds the authorization request, then opens the browser to the authorization endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The user then authenticates with Auth0 (using username/password, social login, or MFA). Auth0 redirects the browser to the MCP client’s registered redirect URI with an authorization code.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The MCP client exchanges the code at the token endpoint and Auth0 returns the access token completing the original OAuth flow.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    After receiving an access token (and refresh token), the MCP client will use the access token to make authenticated calls to the MCP server's tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workforce Identity for MCP

Integrate your MCP environment with your enterprise identity provider using your **Workforce Single Sign-On (SSO)**. Auth0 connects to Okta, Entra ID, Ping, Google Workspace, and other IdPs so employees can authenticate with existing credentials before any MCP connection begins.

This pattern provides:

* Unified workforce authentication and MFA for MCP Servers
* Centralized access policy enforcement and device posture checks
* Consistent session context across all agent interactions

Workforce identity ensures that every request to an MCP Server originates from a verified employee identity governed by your enterprise security controls.
