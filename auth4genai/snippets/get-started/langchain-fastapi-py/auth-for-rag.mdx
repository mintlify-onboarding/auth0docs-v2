### Download sample app
Start by downloading and extracting the sample app. Then open in your preferred IDE.
<DownloadQuickstartButton
  category="authorization-for-rag"
  framework="langchain-fastapi-py"
/>

The project is divided into two parts:

- `backend/`: contains the backend code for the Web app and API written in Python using FastAPI and the LangGraph agent.
- `frontend/`: contains the frontend code for the Web app written in React as a Vite SPA.

### Install dependencies

In the `backend` directory of your project, install the following dependencies:

- `auth0-ai-langchain`: [Auth0 AI SDK for LangChain](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-ai-python/tree/main/packages/auth0-ai-langchain) built for AI agents powered by LangChain.
- `langgraph`: [LangGraph](https://pypi.org/project/langgraph/) for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- `langchain-openai`: [OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/openai) provider for LangChain.
- `langgraph-cli`: LangGraph CLI for running a local LangGraph server.
- `openfga-sdk`: OpenFGA SDK for Fine-Grained Authorization.

Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash wrap lines
cd backend
uv sync
uv add "auth0-ai-langchain>=1.0.0b4" openfga-sdk langgraph langchain-openai "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --prerelease=allow
```

### Update the environment file

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the variables with your Auth0 credentials. You can find your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret in the application you created in the Auth0 Dashboard.

import SetupFGAStore from "/snippets/get-started/common/setup-fga-store.mdx";

<SetupFGAStore />

### Secure the RAG tool

After configuring your FGA Store, secure the RAG tool using Auth0 FGA and Auth0 AI SDK.

The starter application is already configured to handle documents and embeddings.

**Document Upload and Storage**

- You can upload documents through the API endpoints (`backend/app/api/routes/documents.py`).
- Uploaded documents are processed and stored with embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- APIs for uploading and retrieving documents are defined in the application routes.
- Database models are defined in `backend/app/models`.
- FGA helpers are implemented in `backend/app/core/fga.py`.
- Documents are stored as embeddings in a PostgreSQL vector database (`backend/app/core/rag.py`).

**Access Control with Auth0 FGA**

- When a document is uploaded, the app automatically creates [FGA tuples](https://docs.fga.dev/fga-concepts#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) to define which users can access which documents. A tuple signifies a user's relation to a given object. For example, the below tuple implies that all users can view the `<document name>` object.
- Navigate to the **Tuple Management** section to see the tuples being added. If you want to manually add a tuple for a document, click **+ Add Tuple**. Fill in the following information:
  - **User**: `user:*`
  - **Object**: select doc and add `<document name>` in the ID field
  - **Relation**: `viewer`

#### Create a RAG tool

Define a RAG tool that uses the `FGARetriever` to filter authorized data from the vector database:

```python backend/app/agents/tools/context_docs.py wrap lines
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_core.tools import StructuredTool
from auth0_ai_langchain import FGARetriever
from openfga_sdk.client.models import ClientBatchCheckItem
from pydantic import BaseModel

from app.core.rag import get_vector_store

class GetContextDocsSchema(BaseModel):
    question: str


async def get_context_docs_fn(question: str, config: RunnableConfig):
    """Use the tool when user asks for documents or projects or anything that is stored in the knowledge base"""

    if "configurable" not in config or "_credentials" not in config["configurable"]:
        return "There is no user logged in."

    credentials = config["configurable"]["_credentials"]
    user = credentials.get("user")

    if not user:
        return "There is no user logged in."

    user_email = user.get("email")
    vector_store = await get_vector_store()

    if not vector_store:
        return "There is no vector store."

    retriever = FGARetriever(
        retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
        build_query=lambda doc: ClientBatchCheckItem(
            user=f"user:{user_email}",
            object=f"doc:{doc.metadata.get('document_id')}",
            relation="can_view",
        ),
    )

    documents = retriever.invoke(question)
    return "\n\n".join([document.page_content for document in documents])


get_context_docs = StructuredTool(
    name="get_context_docs",
    description="Use the tool when user asks for documents or projects or anything that is stored in the knowledge base",
    args_schema=GetContextDocsSchema,
    coroutine=get_context_docs_fn,
)
```

#### Use the RAG tool from AI agent

Call the tool from your AI agent to get data from documents. First, update the `backend/app/api/routes/chat.py` file with the following code to pass the user credentials to your agent:

```python backend/app/api/routes/chat.py wrap lines highlight={2,9,21}
# ...
from app.core.auth import auth_client
# ...

@agent_router.api_route(
    "/{full_path:path}", methods=["GET", "POST", "DELETE", "PATCH", "PUT", "OPTIONS"]
)
async def api_route(
    request: Request, full_path: str, auth_session=Depends(auth_client.require_session)
):
    try:
        # ... existing code

        # Prepare body
        body = await request.body()
        if request.method in ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH") and body:
            content = await request.json()
            content["config"] = {
                "configurable": {
                    "_credentials": {
                        "user": auth_session.get("user"),
                    }
                }
            }
            body = json.dumps(content).encode("utf-8")

            # ... existing code
```

Now, update the `backend/app/agents/assistant0.py` file with the following code to add the tool to your agent:

```python backend/app/agents/assistant0.py wrap lines highlight={2,4}
# ...
from app.agents.tools.context_docs import get_context_docs

tools = [get_context_docs]

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini")

# ... existing code
agent = create_react_agent(
    llm,
    tools=ToolNode(tools, handle_tool_errors=False),
    prompt=get_prompt(),
)
```

### Test your application

To test the application, start the database, FastAPI backend, LangGraph server, and the frontend:

1. Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash wrap lines
cd backend
# start the postgres database
docker compose up -d
# start the FastAPI backend
source .venv/bin/activate
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

2. In another terminal, start the LangGraph server:

```bash wrap lines
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -U langgraph-api
langgraph dev --port 54367 --allow-blocking
```

<Note>
  This will open the LangGraph Studio in a new tab. You can close it as we won't
  require it for testing the application.
</Note>

3. In another terminal, start the frontend:

```bash wrap lines
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env # Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the URL `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
Upload a document from the documents tab and ask your AI agent a question about the document. You should get a response with the relevant information.

Go to an incognito window, log in as a different user, and ask it the same question. You should not get a response.

Share the document from the documents page to the second user and try again. You should see the information now.

That's it! You successfully integrated RAG protected by Auth0 FGA into your project.
