### Download sample app
Start by downloading and extracting the sample app. Then open in your preferred IDE.
<DownloadQuickstartButton
  category="authenticate-users"
  framework="langchain-fastapi-py"
/>

The project is divided into these two folders:

- `backend`: contains the backend code for the web application, an API written in Python using FastAPI and the LangGraph agent.
- `frontend`: contains the frontend code for the web application written in React as a Vite Single Page App (SPA).

### Install backend packages

In the `backend` directory of your project, install the required packages using your preferred package manager, such as `uv`. You can follow the instructions to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) in its documentation.

```bash wrap lines
cd backend
uv sync
```

### Create your environment file

In the `backend` directory of your project, create a new file and name it `.env` and add the following content:

```bash .env wrap lines
APP_BASE_URL='http://localhost:8000'
AUTH0_SECRET='random 32 byte value'
AUTH0_DOMAIN='<your-auth0-domain>'
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='<your-auth0-application-client-id>'
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='<your-auth0-application-client-secret>'
```
Access your `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` by viewing the Auth0 Application that you created in the Auth0 Dashboard and navigating to the Basic Information section at the top of the Settings tab.
Copy each value to the matching setting.

Next, run this command to generate a random 32 byte value and copy it to the `AUTH0_SECRET` field.
```bash generate random 32 byte value
openssl rand -hex 32
```
### Install frontend packages

Ensure you have `npm` installed or follow the instructions here to [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
Navigate to the `frontend` directory of your project and install the required packages:

```bash wrap lines
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run your application

To run your application, start both the FastAPI backend and the frontend in two terminals:

1. In one terminal, start the FastAPI backend:

```bash wrap lines
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
fastapi dev app/main.py
```

2. In a second new terminal, start the frontend:

```bash wrap lines
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit the URL `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

You will see:

Sign up to your application to create a new user account. You will then see a welcome message with your user name. You can sign in with that account on future visits.
