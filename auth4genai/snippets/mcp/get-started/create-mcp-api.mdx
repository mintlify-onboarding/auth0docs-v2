An MCP server is treated just like any other [API](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis) in your Auth0 tenant, which means you can use the same access control, scoping, and authorization features. The API (also known as a Resource Server) represents your protected MCP Server.

Run the following command to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis) in Auth0:

```shell wrap lines
auth0 api post resource-servers --data '{
  "identifier": "http://localhost:3001/",
  "name": "MCP Tools API",
  "signing_alg": "RS256",
  "token_dialect": "rfc9068_profile_authz",
  "enforce_policies": true,
  "scopes": [
    {"value": "tool:whoami", "description": "Access the WhoAmI tool"},
    {"value": "tool:greet", "description": "Access the Greeting tool"}
  ]
}'
```

Note that `rfc9068_profile_authz` is used as the [token dialect](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/enable-role-based-access-control-for-apis#token-dialect-options) to include the `permissions` claim in the access token, which can be useful for the API to check user permissions without making additional calls.
