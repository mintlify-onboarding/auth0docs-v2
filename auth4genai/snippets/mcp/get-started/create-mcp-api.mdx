## Create an API to represent your MCP server

The API (also known as a Resource Server) represents your protected MCP Server. An MCP server is treated just like any other API in your Auth0 tenant, which means you can use the same access control, scoping, and authorization features you use for your other APIs.

Run the following command to create it in Auth0:

```shell wrap lines
auth0 api post resource-servers --data '{
  "identifier": "http://localhost:3001/",
  "name": "MCP Tools API",
  "signing_alg": "RS256",
  "token_dialect": "rfc9068_profile_authz",
  "enforce_policies": true,
  "scopes": [
    {"value": "tool:whoami", "description": "Access the WhoAmI tool"},
    {"value": "tool:greet", "description": "Access the Greeting tool"}
  ]
}'
```

Note that `rfc9068_profile_authz` is used as the [token dialect](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/enable-role-based-access-control-for-apis#token-dialect-options) to include the `permissions` claim in the access token, which can be useful for the API to check user permissions without making additional calls.

To learn more about APIs in Auth0, see [APIs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis) and [Set Up APIs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis).
