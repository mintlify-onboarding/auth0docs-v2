This guide uses [Auth0 CLI](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/) to configure an Auth0 tenant for secure MCP tool access.
1. Follow the [Auth0 CLI installation instructions](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/).
2. Log in to your account with the Auth0 CLI:
  ```shell wrap lines
  auth0 login --scopes "read:client_grants,create:client_grants,delete:client_grants,read:clients,create:clients,update:clients,read:resource_servers,create:resource_servers,update:resource_servers,read:roles,create:roles,update:roles,update:tenant_settings,read:connections,update:connections"
  ```

  Confirm you are in the correct tenant by double-checking on the terminal the tenant domain, or run the command below:

  ```shell
  auth0 tenants list
  ```

  If more than one tenant is configured, the default tenant will be indicated by an arrow.
