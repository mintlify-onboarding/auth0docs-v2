# Auth0 Documentation

This repository contains source material for https://auth0.com/docs. **Please reach out to Auth0 Product Documentation before you open a PR or contribute to Auth0 Docs.**

## Editing Docs Content
* You can edit Docs content by using the GitHub web editor and editing a file. This is best suited for typos and small changes.
* You can also pull down the `/docs` repo to your computer via Git and edit files in your local editor, before pushing a new branch (or a branch to your own fork of the project). You can then go to GitHub.com and start a PR. 
We will be able to review the changes prior to merging.
  - Regardless of which option you use, again, please review any relevant sections of the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a PR.
