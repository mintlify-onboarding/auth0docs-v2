Create a custom <Tooltip tip="Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): Standardized protocol allowing two parties to exchange authentication information without a password." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=SAML">SAML</Tooltip> connection to Microsoft's Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to get more flexibility when configuring your mappings. To create the custom connection, you will need to:

1. Configure ADFS.
2. Create a SAML connection where Auth0 acts as the service provider.
3. Edit the Relying Party Trust in ADFS.
4. Enable and test your integration.

## Configure ADFS

### Add Relying Party Trust

To learn how to add a <Tooltip tip="Relying Party: Entity (such as a service or application) that depends on a third-party identity provider to authenticate a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=relying+party">relying party</Tooltip> trust, read [Create a relying party trust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-relying-party-trust) at https://docs.microsoft.com.

#### Create using federation metadata

Follow the steps on [Create a claims aware Relying Party Trust using federation metadata (MSDN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-relying-party-trust#to-create-a-claims-aware-relying-party-trust-using-federation-metadata). For the **Federation metadata address** in Step 4, the URL you enter should be in one of these formats:

US: `https://{yourTenantName}.auth0.com/samlp/metadata?connection={connectionName}`

EU: `https://{yourTenantName}.eu.auth0.com/samlp/metadata?connection={connectionName}`

AU: `https://{yourTenantName}.au.auth0.com/samlp/metadata?connection={connectionName}`

JP: `https://{yourTenantName}.jp.auth0.com/samlp/metadata?connection=CONNECTION_NAME`

<Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Custom+domain">Custom domain</Tooltip>: `https://{yourTenantName}/samlp/metadata?connection={connectionName}`

Once you've finished creating the relying party trust, [continue to the next section](#edit-claim-issuance-policy).

#### Create manually

1. Launch your instance of ADFS and start the **Add Relying Party Trust** wizard.
2. On the **Welcome** page, choose **Claims aware** and click **Start**.
3. On the **Select Data Source** page, select **Enter data about the relying party manually** and click **Next**.
4. On the **Specify Display Name** page, provide a descriptive name for your relying party (the typical format is `urn:auth0:{yourTenant}:{yourConnectionName}`) and a brief description under **Notes**. Be sure to replace `{yourConnectionName}` with a unique name you will also use to create a connection in Auth0 in a later step. If you are unsure of the connection name at this time, you can always edit the connection name later. Click **Next**.
5. On the **Configure Certificate** page, click **Next**. (We will come back to configure the certificate later.)
6. On the **Configure URL** page, check the box for **Enable support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol**. The wizard then asks for a **Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL**. For the time being, provide a placeholder URL; we will return to this step later. Click **Next**.
7. On the **Configure Identifiers** page, indicate that the **Relying party trust identifier** is `urn:auth0:{yourTenant}:{yourConnectionName}` (or whatever value you used as the display name when you started using the wizard). Click **Next**.
8. On the **Choose Access Control Policy** page, select **Permit everyone** and click **Next**.
9. Review the settings you provided on the **Ready to Add Trust** page and click **Next** to save your information. If you were successful, you'll see a message indicating that on the **Finish** page.
10. Make sure that the **Configure claims issuance policy for this application** checkbox is selected, and click **Close**.

### Edit Claim Issuance Policy

After you close the **Add Relying Party Trust** wizard, the **Edit Claim Issuance Policy** window appears.

1. Click **Add Rule...** to launch the wizard.
2. Select **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims** for your **Claim rule template**, and click **Next**.
3. Provide a value for the **Claim rule name**, such as "LDAP Attributes" (it can be anything you want).
4. Choose **Active Directory** as your **Attribute Store**.
5. Map your LDAP attributes to the following outgoing claim types:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>LDAP Attribute</th>
<th>Outgoing Claim</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>E-Mail-Addresses</td>
<td>E-Mail Address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display-Name</td>
<td>Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>User-Principal-Name</td>
<td>Name ID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Given-Name</td>
<td>Given Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Surname</td>
<td>Surname</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   The `Name ID` outgoing claim should always be present to ensure correct session handling. We strongly recommend adding all of the claims listed above, especially `E-Mail Address`, since they are the ones most commonly used. You can add additional claim mappings if necessary.
6. Click **Finish**.
7. In the **Edit Claim Issuance Policy** window, click **Apply**. You can now exit out of this window.

### Export Signing Certificate

Finally, you'll need to export the signing certificate from the ADFS console to upload it to Auth0.

1. Using the left-hand navigation pane, go to **ADFS > Service > Certificates**. Select the **Token-signing** certificate, and right click to select **View Certificate**.
2. On the **Details** tab, click **Copy to File...**. This launches the **Certificate Export Wizard**. Click **Next**.
3. Choose **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** as the format you'd like to use. Click **Next**.
4. Provide the location to where you want the certificate exported. Click **Next**.
5. Verify that the settings for your certificate are correct and click **Finish**.

## Create SAML connection with Auth0 as service provider

1. Follow the tutorial on creating a SAML connection where [Auth0 acts as the service provider](/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider). Where prompted, upload the signing certificate you exported from ADFS.

   The sign in and sign out URLs are usually in the form of `https://your.adfs.server/adfs/ls`.
2. Click **Save**. A page with instructions for creating a new Relying Party Trust in ADFS appears displaying the exact values required for your Auth0 account/connection. Make a note of these values. Here is an example:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Example Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Post-back URL</td>
<td>`https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback?connection=YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME` if a custom domain is configured</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>`https://\{yourDomain}/login/callback?connection=YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME` if not using custom domains</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Entity ID</td>
<td>`urn:auth0:{yourTenant}:YOUR_CONNECTION_NAME`</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Edit Relying Party Trust

1. In the ADFS console, go to **ADFS > Relying Party Trusts** using the left-hand navigation pane. Select the Relying Party Trust you created earlier and click **Properties** (located on the right-hand navigation pane).
2. Select the **Identifiers** tab, and populate the **Relying Party Identifier** with the **Entity ID** value from the previous screen. Be sure to click **Add** to add the identifier to your list.
3. Select the **Endpoints** tab, and select the placeholder URL you provided earlier. Click **Edit...**.
4. Populate the **Trusted URL** with the **Post-back URL** value.
5. Click **OK**. Finally, click **Apply** and exit the Properties window.

## Enable sign requests (optional)

Optionally, you can sign your SAML requests to the ADFS server.

1. Go to the **Settings** page for your SAML-P Identity Provider in the Auth0 Dashboard.
2. Enable **Sign Requests**.
3. Just below the **Sign Requests** toggle is a link to download your certificate.
4. Return to ADFS and load the downloaded certificate using the **Signatures** tab of the Relying Party properties dialog.

## Enable and test the integration

Before you test your integration, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

* Create a user on the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> that you can use to test your new connection.
* Enable your Connection for at least one application.

1. Go to [Authentication > Enterprise > SAML](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise/samlp).
2. Select the connection that you want to test and click the ellipses (...) then click **Try**. The Microsoft Sign in screen will appear. Sign in and click **Next**.
