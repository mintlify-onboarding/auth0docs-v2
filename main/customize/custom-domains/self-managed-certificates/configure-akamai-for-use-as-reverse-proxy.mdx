To set up an Akamai product as a reverse proxy, complete the following:

1. Verify the ownership of your custom domain. To learn more, read [Verify Ownership](/customize/custom-domains/auth0-managed-certificates#verify-ownership).
2. Go to [Dashboard > Settings > Custom Domains](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/custom_domains) to gather the distribution, origin custom header, origin hostname, and default cache behavior settings. Then, use this information to update your Akamai custom domain settings to point to the reverse proxy server domain. To learn more, read [Configure reserve proxy](/customize/custom-domains/self-managed-certificates#configure-reverse-proxy).
3. Update the custom domain client IP header using the Management API PATCH  `/api/v2/custom-domains/{id}` endpoint as below:

   ```json lines
   { 
   "custom_client_ip_header": "true-client-ip" 
   }
   ```


   

   

   To learn more, read [Update custom domain configuration](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Custom_Domains/patch_custom_domains_by_id).

For details on how to configure Akamai as a reverse proxy using the information above, refer to Akamai documentation or customer support.
