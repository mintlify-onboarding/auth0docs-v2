Auth0 allows you to configure your own SMTP email provider so you can more completely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications. Auth0's built-in email infrastructure should be used for testing emails only.

## Prerequisites

* To ensure that emails can be sent from Auth0 to your SMTP, open ports and allow inbound connections from specific IP addresses. To update the list of IPs, navigate to [Dashboard > Branding](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider) [>](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider) [Emails Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider). See [Add IP Addresses to AllowList](/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist) for details.
* You must have a [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/signup/) account.

## Configure Mandrill

1. Log in to [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/signup/).
2. Navigate to Mandrill [Settings](https://mandrillapp.com/settings), and click **Add API key**. Copy this key value.
3. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
4. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
5. Click the **Mandrill** logo.
6. Provide a **From** email address, enter the Mandrill **API Key** you previously copied.
7. Click **Save**.

## Test email

You can now send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If you have configured everything correctly, you will receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for any failures.

The Mandrill [Outbound Activity](https://mandrillapp.com/activity) page will now display delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
