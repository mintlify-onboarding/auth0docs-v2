Auth0 allows you to configure your own SMTP email provider so you can more completely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications. Auth0's built-in email infrastructure should be used for testing emails only.

## Prerequisites

* To ensure that emails can be sent from Auth0 to your SMTP, open ports and allow inbound connections from specific IP addresses. To update the list of IPs, navigate to [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider). See [Add IP Addresses to AllowList](/secure/security-guidance/data-security/allowlist) for details.
* You must have a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) account. If you have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a free account in the Azure Marketplace.

## Configure SendGrid

1. Log in to your [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) account.
2. Navigate to SendGrid **Settings > API Keys**, and click **Create API Key**.
3. Type a name for your key and select **Restricted Access**.
4. Under **Access Details**, click to expand **Mail Send**.
5. Set the **Mail Send** permission to **Full Access**.
6. Click **Save** and copy the key value.
7. Navigate to Auth0 [Dashboard > Branding > Email Provider](https://manage.auth0.com/#/branding/email_provider).
8. Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle.
9. Click the **SendGrid** logo.
10. Type a **From** email address, paste the SendGrid **API Key** you copied, and click **Save**.

**Note:** If you are using [passwordless authentication with email](/authenticate/passwordless#email), ensure that the **From** email address value for your <Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> connection matches the **From** email address value you're using for SendGrid.

## Test email

You can now send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If you have configured everything correctly, you will receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [Auth0 logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for any failures.

The SendGrid [Email Activity](https://sendgrid.com/logs/index) page will now display delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.
