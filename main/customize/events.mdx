<Warning>

**Events are currently available in Early Access**.

To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, review [Product Release Stages](/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Warning>

Events offer Auth0 customers an API-based method of synchronizing, correlating, or orchestrating changes that occur within Auth0 or 3rd-party <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip> (IdPs) to external apps or 3rd-party services.

## Use cases

Events are real-time notifications about specific actions – initially changes to a user, but eventually others – that have occurred within your Auth0 tenant. You can create event streams that listen for these events to orchestrate asynchronous changes (i.e., changes to an entity or flow that have been completed) in Auth0 and forward them to one of many destinations for external processing. Events support a variety of use cases, including:

* Sending emails to new customers to welcome them or ask them to verify their email address.
* Monitoring user lifecycle changes so that you can update CRM (customer relationship management) or billing systems.
