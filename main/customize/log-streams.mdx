Auth0's log streaming service allows you to export tenant logs to a log analysis service. You can choose the content type and form and preview the payload using the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. Log streaming allows you to react to log events like password changes or new registrations with your own business logic. Using the Auth0 Dashboard and API, you can pause a stream, view and update settings, and check the health of the stream.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

By enabling Log Streams, Customer becomes the Controller of such information and is responsible for the data exported from the Auth0 Platform, including what information is streamed and how it is used by Customer.

You can create a new log stream in the Auth0 Dashboard using one of the services we support or you can configure a stream to a service you already use with a custom webhook.

## Delivery attempts

Auth0 delivers each log to your server as it is triggered in our system. We guarantee logs are delivered at least once.

When a log is triggered:

1. We attempt to deliver the log to your server up to three times.
2. If we fail to reach your server by the third attempt, we log an error visible in the **Health** view for the log stream.
3. We restart this process for any errored log until the problem is resolved.

If we fail to reach your server for 7 consecutive days, we'll automatically pause the stream. You'll need to resolve the issue, and then resume the stream manually.

## Log retention

Your Auth0 log retention period depends on your [subscription level](/deploy-monitor/logs/log-data-retention).

If there is an issue where your server does not receive logs sent from Auth0, you can delete the stream and then recreate it with the Starting Cursor field set to a specific day and time within the retention period.

## Filtering and PII obfuscation

Customers can choose which [filter categories](/deploy-monitor/logs/log-event-filters) of their logs to stream and which to exclude to ensure the external destination receives only the relevant data. Customers can also choose to mask or hash Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in the streamed logs.

### PII obfuscation

Auth0 provides two ways to obfuscate PII tenant log fields when streaming to third-party destinations:

* **Masking:** the field values are replaced with asterisks
* **xxHash:** a fast, non-cryptographic hash algorithm

The customer can obfuscate the following log data and field names when streaming:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Data</strong></th>
<th><strong>Field name</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>first_name</code></td>
<td><code>first_name</code><br/><code>given_name</code><br/><code>name</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>last_name</code></td>
<td><code>last_name</code><br/><code>family_name</code><br/><code>name</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>email</code></td>
<td><code>email</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>phone</code></td>
<td><code>phone</code><br/><code>phone_number</code><br/><code>old_phone_number</code><br/><code>new_phone_number</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>address</code></td>
<td><code>address</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>username</code></td>
<td><code>username</code><br/><code>user_name</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
