## Pagination

For Public Cloud tenants, Management API endpoints return a maximum of 50 results per response. When there are more results than can be returned in a response, include the `page` and `per_page` parameters in your request to retrieve more results.

See [Migrate to Management API v2 Endpoint Paginated Queries](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/past-migrations/migrate-to-paginated-queries) for information on updating your applications.

## Management API v1 (Deprecated)

The Management API v1 is deprecated and should not be used for new projects.

Management API v1 reached its End of Life on **July 13, 2020**. You may have been required to take action before that date to ensure no interruption to your service. Notifications were sent to customers that needed to complete this migration.
