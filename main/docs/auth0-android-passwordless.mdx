<Warning>

Passwordless authentication from native applications is disabled by default for new tenants as of 8 June 2017. Users are encouraged to use Universal Login and perform Web Authentication instead. If you still want to proceed you'll need to enable the MFA Grant Type on your dashboard first. See [Application Grant Types](/get-started/applications/application-grant-types) for more information.

</Warning>

<Tooltip tip="Passwordless: Form of authentication that does not rely on a password as the first factor." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Passwordless">Passwordless</Tooltip> can occur over email or SMS, either by sending the user a code or sending a link that contains a code. All methods of Passwordless authentication require two steps: requesting the code and inputting the code for verification.

## Set up the Android SDK

First, [set up the Android SDK](/libraries/auth0-android) so that you can use the Passwordless methods below.

## Configure Auth0 and the Android SDK

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Using the Passwordless API requires setting using the Auth0 Android SDK version 1.20 or higher.

</Callout>

To use the Passwordless API from a Native client, enable the Passwordless OTP grant for your application in **Dashboard > Applications > (YOUR APPLICATION) > Settings > Advanced Settings > Grant Types**.

## Request the code

This example requests the code by calling `passwordlessWithEmail` with the user's email, `PasswordlessType.CODE`, and the name of the connection as parameters. On success, you may want to notify the user that their code is on the way, and perhaps route them to where they will input that code.

```kotlin lines
authentication
    .passwordlessWithEmail("username@domain.com", PasswordlessType.CODE, "my-passwordless-connection")
    .start(object: Callback<Void?, AuthenticationException>() {
        override fun onSuccess(result: Void?) {
            // Code sent!
        }

        override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
            // Error!
        }
    })
```






You can use the `passwordlessWithSms` method to send the code using SMS.

## Input the code

Once the user has a code, they can input it. Call the `loginWithEmail` method and pass in the user's email, the code they received, and the name of the connection in question. Upon success, you receive a `Credentials` object in the response.

```kotlin lines
authentication
    .loginWithEmail("username@domain.com", "123456", "my-passwordless-connection")
    .start(object: Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException>() {
        override fun onSuccess(result: Credentials) {
            // Logged in!
        }

        override fun onFailure(error: AuthenticationException) {
            // Error!
        }
    })
```






You can use the `loginWithSms` method to send the code received by SMS and authenticate the user.

The default scope used is `openid profile email`.
