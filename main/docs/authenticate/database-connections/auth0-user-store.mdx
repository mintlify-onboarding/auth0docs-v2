Auth0 provides the database infrastructure to store your users by default. This scenario provides the best performance for the authentication process since all data is stored in Auth0.

The Auth0-hosted database is highly secure. Passwords are never stored or logged in plain text but are hashed with **bcrypt**. Varying levels of password security requirements can also be enforced. To learn more, read [Password Strength in Auth0 Database Connections](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/password-strength).

For database connections, Auth0 limits the number of repeat login attempts per user and IP address. To learn more, read [User/Password Authentication Rate Limits](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy/database-connections-rate-limits).

## Migrating to Auth0 from a custom user store

In this scenario, you have a legacy user store and wish to switch to the Auth0 store. Auth0 provides an automatic migration feature that adds your users to the Auth0 database one-at-a-time as each logs in and avoids asking your users to reset their passwords all at the same time. To learn more, read [Configure Automatic Migration from Your Database](/docs/manage-users/user-migration/configure-automatic-migration-from-your-database).
