You can enable passkeys as an authentication method and configure your passkey policy in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>.

## Prerequisites

To enable passkeys as an authentication method for your database connection, you must configure your Auth0 tenant to fulfill the following prerequisites.

If these prerequisites are not met and you try to enable passkeys, the Auth0 Dashboard displays the **Passkey Authentication Prerequisites** readiness checklist and shows any unmet requirements.

<Frame>![](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/51aI3GgLqE4rTw93V26DZ0/73a0fe3efc42e2963586a01718f36ab7/Passkey_policy_-_English.png)</Frame>

After you enable passkeys as an authentication method for a database connection, you can use the readiness checklist to monitor the status of each requirement and access the relevant settings.

To view the **Passkey Authentication Prerequisites** readiness checklist:

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/connections/database).
2. Select a connection.
3. Switch to the **Authentication Methods** view.
4. Select **Configure** on the **Passkeys** card.

### Enable New Universal Login Experience

Enable and configure the [New Universal Login Experience](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/universal-login-vs-classic-login/universal-experience).

#### Disable Custom Login Page setting

The **Customize Login Page** setting allows you to customize login pages when using a [custom domain](/docs/customize/custom-domains).

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [Branding > Universal Login > Advanced Options > Login](https://manage.auth0.com/#/login_page).
2. Disable the **Custom Login Page** toggle.

### Enable Identifier First authentication

Enable and configure [Identifier First authentication](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/identifier-first).

### Update database connection settings

You must update specific settings for your database connection to use passkeys as an authentication method.

#### Disable Requires Username setting

The **Requires Username** setting requires users to provide both a username and their email when logging in to a database connection.

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database).
2. Select a connection.
3. Switch to the **Settings** view.
4. Disable the **Requires Username** toggle.

#### Disable Use my own database setting unless Import Users to Auth0 setting is enabled

The **Use my own database** setting allows you to use an external database to store users on a [custom database](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/create-db-connection) connection.

The **Import Users to Auth0** settings allows you to automatically import users from an external database to Auth0. For more information, read [Import and Export Users](/docs/manage-users/user-migration/user-migration-scenarios).

If the **Import Users to Auth0** setting is not enabled on your tenant, you must disable the **Use my own database** setting to configure passkeys:

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to [Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database).
2. Select a connection.
3. Switch to the **Custom Database** view.
4. Disable the **Use my own database** toggle.

## Best practices

To ensure the best experience for end users when using passkeys, consider the items below.

* **Configure a <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domain">custom domain</Tooltip>:** When a user enrolls a passkey, it associates with the <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=relying+party">relying party</Tooltip> domain. If the domain name changes at any time, all of the passkeys associated with the old domain become invalid. Configure a [custom domain](/docs/customize/custom-domains) for your tenant prior to enabling passkeys to avoid any interruptions for end-users.
* **Enable passkeys for a single database connection**: Enable passkeys for a maximum of one database connection.
* **Consider limitations for Organization users:** Users cannot use passkeys when creating an account through an [Organization invitation email](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/invite-members). To allow these users to create passkeys, use an alternate method of user creation or ensure [progressive enrollment](#progressive-enrollment) is enabled.

## Enable passkeys as an authentication method

You can enable passkeys as an authentication method for your database connection in the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Go to [Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database).
2. Select a connection.
3. Switch to the **Authentication Methods** view.
4. Enable the toggle on the **Passkey** card.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Currently, if you enable passkeys for a connection, you must also configure passwords as a backup authentication method. This ensures users can continue to access their accounts from browsers and older devices that may not yet support passkeys.

</Callout>

## Configure your policy

You can configure the passkey policy for your database connection in the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Go to [Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database).
2. Select a connection.
3. Switch to the **Authentication Methods** view.
4. Select **Configure** on the **Passkey** card.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

As passkeys already offer a more secure experience, users leveraging passkeys can choose to skip secondary verification challenges, such as CAPTCHA. Users authenticating with passwords or other traditional methods must continue to complete secondary verification when prompted.

</Callout>

### Passkey Challenge

This setting determines how users can trigger passkey authentication during login and signup.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Passkey authentication UI</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Autofill</td>
<td>Users must log in with their browser’s autofill feature to leverage passkeys. Autofill allows users to select a saved account from a dropdown menu when engaging with the login prompt. With autofill, users do not need to manually enter their credentials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Passkey button</td>
<td>Users must select the <strong>Continue with a passkey</strong> button on the login prompt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both</td>
<td>Users can trigger passkey authentication using autofill or by selecting the <strong>Continue with a passkey</strong> button on the login prompt.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Users can only use autofill if the functionality has been enabled in their browser settings. If autofill is not available, users can log in using the **Passkey** button or their traditional credentials.

</Callout>

### Progressive Enrollment

Enabled by default, progressive enrollment prompts users to create a passkey (if they have not done so already) after logging in with their email and password. This step is not required and users can choose to delay this action every 30 days.

Progressive enrollment is useful when migrating users to a new passkey flow as it offers a more seamless transition between authentication methods.

When a user creates their passkey, it is added to their account as an authentication method. Their standard email or username and password remain valid and can be used to log in as needed. Passkeys do not replace or invalidate users’ standard credentials.

### Local Enrollment

Enabled by default, local enrollment prompts existing users to create a local passkey when using a cross-device passkey to log in to a new device.

For example, existing passkey users can use a QR code to log in to a new device that is within physical proximity of a previously-enrolled device. If local enrollment is enabled in this scenario, the user is prompted to create a local passkey on the new device after they log in with the QR code. If desired, users can choose to skip this action.
