Introduction to the various sources of users for applications, including <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip>, databases, and <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=passwordless">passwordless</Tooltip> authentication methods.

A connection is the relationship between Auth0 and a source of users, which may include external Identity Providers (such as Google or LinkedIn), databases, or passwordless authentication methods. Auth0 sits between your application and its sources of users, which adds a level of abstraction, so your application is isolated from any changes to and idiosyncrasies of each source's implementation.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. You can disable synchronization to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.

You can configure any number of connections for your applications.
