You can monitor the service status using System Center as you would do with any other service.

4. Select the limits of **CPU** and **Memory limits**. For example, 10% of CPU and 200MB of RAM are good limits to trigger alerts.

We also recommend that you set up a synthetic transaction to monitor end-to-end authentication.
