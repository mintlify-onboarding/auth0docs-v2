---
You can deploy multiple instances of the AD/LDAP Connector to provide a high-availability environment for your AD/LDAP connection.

## Overview

To deploy multiple instances of the AD/LDAP Connector, you'll need to:

1. Install the AD/LDAP Connector on the primary server.
2. Copy or export the configuration files of the initial installation.
3. Install the AD/LDAP Connector on additional servers.
4. Import the configuration files from the initial installation to the additional connectors.

## Configure primary server

1. Install and configure the AD/LDAP Connector on the first server.
2. Open the troubleshooting screen (`http://localhost:8357/#troubleshoot`) and run the troubleshooting test. Make sure all tests pass.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Test</th>

<th>Troubleshoot</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Test 1</td>
<td>Attempts to establish a TCP connection to the LDAP server and port specified.</td>
<td>Check basic network connectivity and firewall settings that might prevent such a connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test 2</td>
<td>Attempts to perform an LDAP bind on the LDAP server and port specified and with the username and password provided.</td>
<td>Check the LDAP connection string, search path, username and password.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test 3</td>
<td>Attempts to perform an LDAP search against the directory to check the privileges of the specified username.</td>
<td>Check the privileges of the username in the target directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test 4</td>
<td>Attempts to establish a connection to the Auth0 server.</td>
<td>Check network connectivity and firewall settings that might prevent such a connection.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
3. Copy or export the configuration files.

## Configure additional server(s)

1. Install the AD/LDAP Connector on the additional server(s), but do not configure it.
2. Import the configuration files from the primary server.
3. Restart the Auth0 AD/LDAP and Auth0 AD/LDAP Admin Windows Services on the new server(s).
4. Open the troubleshooting screen (`http://localhost:8357/#troubleshoot`) and run the troubleshooting test. Make sure all tests pass.

## Verify connections

In the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>, go to the [Authentication > Enterprise > Active Directory / LDAP](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise/ad), and confirm that the connection is active.

If you are encountering issues getting your connection online, read [Troubleshoot AD/LDAP Connector](/docs/troubleshoot/integration-extensibility-issues/troubleshoot-ad-ldap-connector).

## Using Kerberos or client certificates

If you enable Kerberos or client certificates for authentication on your AD/LDAP connection, users contact the AD/LDAP Connector directly instead of going through the Auth0 server.

If you are using a high-availability configuration with multiple connectors, Auth0 recommends that you front them with a network load balancer:

1. Use the `SERVER_URL` parameter to publish the public location where the AD/LDAP Connector will be listening to incoming requests.
2. Map the `SERVER_URL` in the network load balancer to all internal instances of the deployed AD/LDAP Connectors. A special distribution policy is not required (for example, uniform round-robin with no sticky sessions works).
