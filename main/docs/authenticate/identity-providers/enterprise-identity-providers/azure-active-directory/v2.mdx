<Card title="Overview">

Key Concepts

* Follow the steps to register your application with Azure AD and connect to your Auth0 instance.
* Test the connection before taking your configuration to production.
* Review the troubleshooting tips.

</Card>

<Warning>

**Important:** Extended attributes on Azure Active Directory (v1) connections Because Microsoft is deprecating and retiring the Azure AD Graph API, connections using the Azure Active Directory (v1) Identity API can no longer newly enable Get extended profile, Get user groups, or Get nested groups (`options.ext_profile`, `options.ext_groups`, `options.ext_nested_groups`). For existing v1 connections, these options remain only if already enabled, but will stop working entirely once Microsoft’s Graph API retirement is complete in 2025. Extended attributes remain supported for connections using the Microsoft Identity Platform (v2) Identity API, which relies on Microsoft Graph and requires the delegated permissions `User.Read` and `Directory.Read.All`.

</Warning>


You can integrate with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) if you want to let users:

* From within your company use your application from an Azure AD controlled by you or your organization.
* From other companies' Azure ADs use your application. (We recommend that you configure external directories as different connections.)

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Claims returned from the Azure AD enterprise connection are static; custom or optional claims will not appear in user profiles. If you need to include custom or optional claims in user profiles, use a SAML or OIDC connection instead.

</Callout>

## Steps

To connect your application to Azure AD, you must:

1. [Register your app with Azure AD](#register-your-app-with-azure-ad)
2. [Create an enterprise connection in Auth0](#create-an-enterprise-connection-in-auth0)
3. [Enable the enterprise connection for your Auth0 Application](#enable-the-enterprise-connection-for-your-auth0-application)
4. [Test the connection](#test-the-connection)

### Register your app with Azure AD

To register your app with Azure AD, see Microsoft's [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

<Warning>

If you have more than one Azure AD directory, make sure you are in the correct directory when you register the app you want to use with Auth0.

</Warning>

During registration, configure the following settings:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Setting</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Supported account types</strong></td>
<td>To enable SCIM-based user provisioning from this directory, select <strong>Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)</strong>. To allow users from external organizations (like other Azure AD directories) choose the appropriate multitenant option. Multitenant options include the following: <strong>Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Redirect URI</strong></td>
<td>Select a Redirect URI type of <strong>Web</strong>, and enter your callback URL: `https://{yourDomain}/login/callback`.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Card title="Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects">

If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our [custom domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains) feature, your domain name is a concatenation of your tenant name, your regional subdomain, and `auth0.com`, separated by the dot (`.`) symbol.

For example, if your tenant name is `exampleco-enterprises`, and your tenant is in the US region, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your **Redirect URI** would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`.

However, if your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020, then your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your **Redirect URI** would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains), your **Redirect URI** would be `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

</Card>

During this process, Microsoft generates an **Application (client) ID** for your application; you can find this on the app's **Overview** screen. **Make note of this value.**

#### Create a client secret

To create a <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=client+secret">client secret</Tooltip>, see Microsoft's [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs - Add Credentials to your web application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-credentials).

Once generated, **make note of this value**.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

If you configure an expiring secret, make sure to **record the expiration date**; you will need to renew the key before that day to avoid a service interruption.

</Callout>

#### Add permissions

To add permissions, see Microsoft's [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access web APIs - Add permissions to access web APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-permissions-to-access-web-apis).

While configuring permissions, consider the following:

If you want to enable extended attributes (such as E**xtended Profile** or **Security Groups**), then you will need to configure the following permissions for the **Microsoft Graph API**.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Delegated Permissions</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Users &gt; User.Read</strong></td>
<td>So your app can sign in users and read the signed-in users' profiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Directory &gt; Directory.Read.All</strong></td>
<td>So your app can read directory data on the signed-in user's behalf.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Create an enterprise connection in Auth0

Create and configure an Azure AD Enterprise Connection in Auth0. Make sure you have the **Application (client) ID** and the **Client secret** generated when you set up your app in the Microsoft Azure portal.

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Enterprise](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/enterprise), locate **Microsoft Azure AD**, and select its `+`.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

   Optional fields are available with Universal Login only. Customers using Classic Login will not see the Add button, Button display name, or Button logo URL.

   </Callout>
5. If you have appropriate Azure AD administrative permissions to give consent to the application so users can log in, then click **Continue**.
   You will be asked to [log in to your Azure AD account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#requesting-consent-for-an-entire-tenant) and give consent. Otherwise, provide the given URL to your administrator so that they can give consent.

### Enable the enterprise connection for your Auth0 application

To use your new Azure AD enterprise connection, you must first [enable the connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/enable-enterprise-connections) for your Auth0 Applications.

### Test the connection

Now you're ready to [test your connection](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/test-enterprise-connections).

## Troubleshooting

Here are some troubleshooting tips:

**I registered my application with Azure AD, but when I go back to my Azure Active Directory App registrations, I can't see my application.**

You may have accidentally registered your app in the wrong Azure AD directory (or not have created an Azure AD directory at all before registering your app). It's likely easiest to re-register your app in Azure AD. Make sure you are in the correct directory when you register the app. If you need to create an Azure AD directory, follow Microsoft's [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory - Create a new tenant for your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization).

**I receive the following error message: "Access cannot be granted to this service because the service listing is not properly configured by the publisher".**

To resolve this, try changing the **Supported account types** for your registered Azure AD app. Make sure you have chosen an appropriate multitenant option in the Azure AD app's Authentication settings. Multitenant options include the following: **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)**.

**When users try to log in, we receive the following error message: "invalid_request; failed to obtain <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip>".**

The most likely reason for this error is an invalid or expired Azure AD **Client secret**. To resolve this, generate a new **Client secret** for your app in Azure AD, then update the **Client Secret** in the enterprise connection configured with Auth0.

## Signing Key Rollover in Azure AD

Signing keys are used by the <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip> to sign the authentication token it issues, and by the consumer application (Auth0 in this case) to validate the authenticity of the generated token.

For security purposes, Azure AD’s signing key [rolls on a periodic basis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-signing-key-rollover). If this happens, **you do not need to take any action**. Auth0 will use the new key automatically.

## Remove unverified label

If you're using a <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domain">custom domain</Tooltip>, the application consent prompt for Azure AD login may label your domain as "unverified". To remove the unverified label:

1. Verify the domain for the Auth0 application: [Add your custom domain name using the Azure Active Directory portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-custom-domain#add-your-custom-domain-name-to-azure-ad).
2. Assign the verified domain to the Auth0 application: [How to: Configure an application's publisher domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-configure-publisher-domain#configure-publisher-domain-using-the-azure-portal).
