First, determine if you want users to use SMS, email, or WebAuthn for device biometrics as the Passwordless authentication method. It is not currently possible to support all three authentication methods in a single login flow.

## Passwordless with email or SMS

You can configure Auth0 so users can authenticate with a magic link or one-time password (OTP) sent to their email, or an OTP sent to their phone number. To learn more, read [Configure Email or SMS for Passwordless Authentication](/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login/email-or-sms).

## Passwordless with WebAuthn with device biometrics

When using WebAuthn with Device Biometrics, users will be able to authenticate with their password, or with any of their devices that support WebAuthn with Device Biometrics.

Each time they login from a new device, Auth0 will offer them the option to use biometrics instead of a password. To learn more, read [Passwordless with WebAuthn with Device Biometrics](/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/passwordless-login/webauthn-device-biometrics).
