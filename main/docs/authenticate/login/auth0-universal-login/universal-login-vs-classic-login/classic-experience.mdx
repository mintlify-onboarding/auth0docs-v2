Classic Login is an Auth0-hosted login experience that relies on JavaScript for customization. Implementing Classic Login is less complex than embedding the authentication process directly in your app, and it can help prevent the dangers of cross-origin authentication.

Classic Login is built on top of Auth0's JavaScript libraries ([Lock.js](/docs/libraries/lock), [auth0.js](/docs/libraries/auth0js), <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> Widget, and Password Reset). When customizing Classic Login pages in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>, the default templates use the same JavaScript libraries to create a more natural transition between the default user interface and a custom one.

After choosing a default template for your Classic Login pages, you can modify it to meet your needs. You can also customize a variety of behavioral and appearance elements of the Lock widget. The Auth0.js templates offer additional flexibility as you can create a custom user interface and modify it to match your application's style.

<Warning>

At this time, Auth0’s active development efforts are focused on Universal Login, and Classic Login no longer receives updates. Unless your specific use case requires the Classic experience, implementing Universal Login is recommended.
