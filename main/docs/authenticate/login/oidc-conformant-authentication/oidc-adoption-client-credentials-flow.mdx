---
The OIDC-conformant pipeline enables the use of the [Client Credentials Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow), which allows applications to authenticate as themselves (rather than on behalf of a user) to programmatically and securely obtain access to an API.

This exchange does not exist in the legacy pipeline; instead, the [Resource Owner Password Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/resource-owner-password-flow) is used to simulate it by creating a **service user**. We strongly discourage this approach in favor of using the Client Credentials Flow, which allows fine-grained permissions to be defined for each API app.

To learn how to execute a Client Credentials Flow, read [Call API Using the Client Credentials Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow/call-your-api-using-the-client-credentials-flow).
