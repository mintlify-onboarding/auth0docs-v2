<Warning>

Native to Web SSO is currently available in Early Access. To use this feature, you must have an Enterprise plan. By using this feature, you agree to the applicable Free Trial terms in Okta’s [Master Subscription Agreement](https://www.okta.com/legal). To learn more about Auth0's product release cycle, read [Product Release Stages](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Warning>

For best results when implementing Native to Web <Tooltip tip="Single Sign-On (SSO): Service that, after a user logs into one applicaton, automatically logs that user in to other applications." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=SSO">SSO</Tooltip>, Auth0 recommends adhering to the best practices compiled below. These guidelines can help ensure session integrity:

## Use Post Login Actions to limit session lifetime

Use [`post-login`](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger) Action triggers to ensure web sessions created through Native to Web SSO are time-boxed appropriately and expire quickly when inactive. 
You can use `post-login` Actions to detect when a session is initiated through a `session_transfer_token` and apply shorter idle and absolute timeouts:

```swift lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  if (event.session_transfer_token) {
    const now = Date.now();

    // Limit the session to 30 minutes total
    api.session.setExpiresAt(now + 30 * 60 * 1000);

    // Set idle timeout to 15 minutes
    api.session.setIdleExpiresAt(now + 15 * 60 * 1000);
  }
};
```






## Bind session_transfer_token to the device or IP address

To reduce the risk of token replay if a token is leaked, logged, or intercepted, always bind the [`session_transfer_token`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id)to the origin environment using `enforce_device_binding`.

## Use secure cookies over query parameters

Send the `session_transfer_token` to the web application using a secure, HTTPOnly cookie scoped to your Auth0 domain to prevent accidental logging or sharing of the token via URLs and to reduce the attack surface for token interception. If you need to use a query parameter (for example, for Chrome Custom Tabs) ensure that the URL uses HTTPS and remove the token from the URL after use.

## Avoid issuing refresh tokens to web apps unless necessary

Only enable [`allow_refresh_token`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id) for web applications that truly need long-lived tokens. In most cases, short-lived <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+tokens">access tokens</Tooltip> combined with silent authentication are sufficient and safer in browser contexts.

## Enable Allow Refresh Tokens when appropriate to set the refresh tokens as “online”

To avoid orphaned credentials and prevent <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=refresh+tokens">refresh tokens</Tooltip> from lingering after logout, use the [`allow_refresh_token`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id) setting to ensure refresh tokens issued via Native to Web SSO are bound to the session that issued them. If the session is revoked or expires, the refresh token is automatically invalidated.

## Enable enforce cascade revocation

To ensure that all web sessions and refresh tokens associated with a `session_transfer_token` are revoked, enable [`enforce_cascade_revocation`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id) in the native application. This is critical to ensure secure session invalidation across applications.
