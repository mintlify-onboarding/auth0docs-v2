The **`@auth0/actions`** NPM package is the **official Actions library** that facilitates the **Auth0 Actions TypeScript definitions**. This helps you code and test your project’s Actions in external editors and IDEs.

---

### Benefits

This library helps you with the following use cases:

* **IDE / Code Editor Assistance**: By referencing this library, IDEs and code editors can help developers coding with **autocompletion**, **object and function definitions**, and **error checking**.
* **TypeScript Development**: Although Actions are still coded and work using Node.js CommonJS, this library enables Actions development on external projects using **TypeScript** which then can be built and deployed as Common JS to the Auth0 Tenant.
* **Unit Testing Improvements**: By enabling TypeScript development on external projects, this library allows developers to follow best practices and to **improve their Unit Testing** based on the TypeScript definitions.
* **AI Actions Generation**: This library gets us one step closer for AI to be able to generate more accurate Action examples.

### How It Works

#### Installation

Use one of the following package managers to install the package as a **development dependency**:

> The package must be used as a development dependency to supplement your development tools.

* **NPM**: `npm install @auth0/actions --save-dev`
* **Yarn**: `yarn add @auth0/actions --dev`
* **Pnpm**: `pnpm add @auth0/actions --save-dev`

#### Import

The library has the following **structure**:

\`\`\`
@auth0/actions
│
└───credentials-exchange
│   └───v1
│   └───v2
└───custom-email-provider
│   └───v1
└───custom-phone-provider
│   └───v1
└───custom-token-exchange
│   └───v1
└───event-stream
│   └───v1
└───password-reset-post-challenge
│   └───v1
└───post-change-password
│   └───v1
│   └───v2
└───post-login
│   └───v1
│   └───v2
│   └───v3
└───post-user-registration
│   └───v1
│   └───v2
└───pre-user-registration
│   └───v1
│   └───v2
└───send-phone-message
    └───v2
\`\`\`

The import statement should be based on each **trigger name** and **version number** considering the previous library structure.

**Follow the pattern**: `@auth0/actions/[trigger_name]/[trigger_version]`

**For example**: `@auth0/actions/post-login/v3`

Use one of the following alternatives to import the TypeScript definitions into your Actions depending on your technology:
