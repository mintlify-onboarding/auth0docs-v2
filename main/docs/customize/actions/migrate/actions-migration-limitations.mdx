---
To take advantage of the features provided by Auth0 Actions, you may need to migrate your current code from Rules, Hooks, or earlier versions of Actions. However, you should be aware of the current limitations when migrating between legacy extensibility offerings and Actions.

For more information, see [Migrate to Actions](/docs/customize/actions/migrate).

## Rule specific differences

* Re-use of functions between Actions is not currently supported, as each Action execution is autonomous. You must explicitly define the required functions for each Action.
* [`accessToken`](/docs/libraries/lock/lock-api-reference#getuserinfo-) is currently limited to 100 scopes.
* The event object in Actions does not currently provide an alternative for the following [context attributes](/docs/customize/rules/context-object)from within a Rule:

  + `context.connectionOptions`
* Actions only support the following properties within [`event.user.identities`](/docs/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-event-object):

  + `connection`
  + `provider`
  + `user_id`
  + `profileData`
  + `isSocial`

If you are using additional properties within `user.identities` object in Rules, they are not supported within an Action. This includes any token from upstream IdP for federated users.

</Callout>

* Standard claims of an `idToken` or `accessToken` cannot be deleted using an Action.
* Actions can only return `access denied`error codes and does not support returning an `unauthorized` error code.
* Actions only support modifying the primary user between linked accounts.

## Hooks specific differences

* You can not modify scopes in a machine-to-machine client credential flowas was possible with a Hook.
