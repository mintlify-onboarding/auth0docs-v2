To set up Cloudflare as a reverse proxy using the recommended approach, a Cloudflare Enterprise Plan with the following features is required:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Feature</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Host Header Override</td>
<td>Rewrite Host headers using different Cloudflare rules. To learn more, read <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/206652947-Using-Page-Rules-to-Re-Write-Host-Headers">Rewrite Host headers on Cloudflare Docs</a>.</td>

<tr>
<td>True-Client-IP Header</td>
<td>Enabling the True-Client-IP Header adds the True-Client-IP header to all requests to your origin server, which includes the end user’s IP address.

## Configure Cloudflare

<Warning>

As a prerequisite, the parent domain for your chosen custom domain must be [added and activated within the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/get-started/add-domain-to-cf/minimize-downtime/#activate-your-domain). Also, confirm that your desired custom domain does not already exist within your Cloudflare zone. If it already exists, Cloudflare verification will fail.

</Warning>

To configure Cloudflare as a reverse proxy, you’ll need to create a CNAME record, a Page Rule, and a Transform Rule in Cloudflare.

1. [Configure and verify a Custom Domain with Self-Managed Certificates](/customize/custom-domains/self-managed-certificates) if you haven't already. Make note of the **Origin Domain Name** and **cname-api-key** values since you'll need these later.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard for the target zone, [create a CNAME record](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records) with the following settings:

   <table class="table"><thead>
   <tr>
   <th><strong>Setting</strong></th>
   <th><strong>Value</strong></th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td>Name</td>
   <td>The custom domain name.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Target</td>
   <td>The <strong>Origin Domain Name</strong> value recorded earlier.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>Proxy Status</td>
   <td><code>Proxied</code></td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>
3. [Create a Page Rule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172336-Creating-Page-Rules) scoped to all URLs under the chosen custom domain and with the following settings:

   <table class="table"><thead>
   <tr>
   <th><strong>Setting</strong></th>
   <th><strong>Value</strong></th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td>Host Header Override</td>
   <td>The <strong>Origin Domain Name</strong> value recorded earlier.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>True-Client-IP</td>
   <td><code>Enable</code></td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>
4. [Create a Transform Rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/request-header-modification/create-dashboard/):

   1. Switch to the **Modify Request Header** view.
   2. Select **Create Rule** and provide a name of your choice.
   3. Under **When incoming requests match**, select **Custom filter expression** and set an expression that scopes the Rule to requests associated with the chosen custom domain. For example, use an exact match on the **Hostname** field.
   4. Under Modify request header, select **Set static**, and then set the following fields:

      <table class="table"><thead>
      <tr>
      <th><strong>Field</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Value</strong></th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>Header name</td>
      <td><code>cname-api-key</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Value</td>
      <td>The <strong>cname-api-key</strong> value recorded earlier.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
5. Ensure that [Always Use HTTPS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/always-use-https/) is enabled and [encryption mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/) is set, at least, to **Full** for your chosen custom domain.

While it is possible to use Cloudflare Workers instead of Page and Transform rules to set up a reverse proxy that meets the requirements for a self-managed certificate custom domain, we recommend using the rules-based approach because it eliminates the need for custom code.
