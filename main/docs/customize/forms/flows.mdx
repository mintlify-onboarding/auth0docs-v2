Flows allow you to visually build the server-side logic that can be executed within your Forms and handle the collected information, integrate any service with an API or trigger automations.

You can use Flows actions with your form to:

* Create custom server-side validations for your form steps.
* Integrate with your own API making custom HTTP requests.
* Integrate with 3rd parties using our out-of-the-box integrations.
* Execute different business logic based based on user input or properties.
* Validate data using <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JSON+Web+Tokens">JSON Web Tokens</Tooltip>.
