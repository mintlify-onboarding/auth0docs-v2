There are many ways to integrate Auth0 with Amazon products and services depending on your specific needs.

## Product integrations

You can read further on how to use the products below to use in addition to your Auth0 and AWS services:

* [CloudFront](/docs/customize/custom-domains/self-managed-certificates/configure-aws-cloudfront-for-use-as-reverse-proxy): Use as a reverse proxy with your <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domain">custom domain</Tooltip>.
* [Simple Email Service (SES)](/docs/customize/email/smtp-email-providers/configure-amazon-ses-as-external-smtp-email-provider): Manage email communications with your users.
* [EventBridge](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/amazon-log-streaming): Stream logs to EventBridge.
* [Cognito](/docs/customize/integrations/aws/amazon-cognito): Use as a backend for your application.
* AWS S3 and DynamoDB:

  + Auth0 provides VPC gateway endpoints for accessing AWS S3 and DynamoDB, which may be needed for [Actions](/docs/customize/actions). This requires `aws:SourceVpc` based IAM policies as described in [Gateway endpoints for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) and [Gateway endpoints for Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-ddb.html). Please contact [Auth0 support](https://www.support.auth0.com) for details on VPC identifiers.

## Identity and access management (IAM) integrations

We have several how-to articles to configure AWS to work with Auth0:

* [Secure AWS API Gateway endpoints using custom authorizers](/docs/customize/integrations/aws/aws-api-gateway-custom-authorizers): Accept Auth0-issued <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+tokens">access tokens</Tooltip>.
* [Use AWS session tags with AWS APIs and resources](/docs/customize/integrations/aws/session-tags): Tag resources and assign users key/value pairs for RBAC.
* [Configure AWS for single sign-on](/docs/customize/integrations/aws/configure-amazon-web-services-for-sso): Allow your users to log in to AWS using any supported <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+provider">identity provider</Tooltip>.
* [Add Amazon login to your app](/docs/customize/integrations/aws/configure-amazon-web-services-for-sso): Allow users to log in to your app using their Amazon profile.
