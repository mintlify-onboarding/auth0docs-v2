By default, **Lock.Android** displays all text in English. If you wish to display text in another language, you may provide a `strings.xml` file and define values to be used for the various text items that Lock might display.

Android asks the device what locale was configured by the user and tries to fetch the list of localized texts for that language. For this to work, the developer needs to add each translation file into the app by using a special folder naming convention as per Android standards. More information can be found in the [Android developer docs](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages).

Some of the default values provided by Lock include:

```xml lines
<resources>
  <string name="com_auth0_lock_social_error_authentication">Error parsing Authentication data</string>
  <string name="com_auth0_lock_social_error_title">There was an error during authentication</string>
  ...
</resources>
```






By providing your own `strings.xml` file, these values can be adjusted as such:

```xml lines
<resources>
  <string name="com_auth0_lock_social_error_authentication">There was an authentication error!</string>
  <string name="com_auth0_lock_social_error_title">Social login error!!</string>
  ...
</resources>
```
