You can use the **Auth0 App for Splunk** to visualize the data from your Auth0 tenant in a Splunk dashboard. The dashboard allows you to monitor the health of the login traffic for a tenant. The app allows you to use recommended aggregations from Auth0, or to use them as a starting point to create your own custom visualizations.

## Install the Auth0 App for Splunk

1. Log into [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/).
2. Navigate to the [Auth0 App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5193) app page.
3. Select the green **Install** button.
4. Enter your username and password, accept the terms and conditions, and select **Login and Install**.
5. On the **Complete** widget that results, select the **Open the App** button.
   The Auth0 Dashboard with default filters applied appears.

## Dashboard filters

The following filters exist to allow you to drill down into the specifics of your traffic. You can enter `*` to search across all values for that field.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Filter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Time Range</td>
<td>A Splunk time input element that lets you choose the duration over which to view events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Index</td>
<td>The Splunk <code>index</code> you want to search within. While creating your <code>Http Event Collector Token</code>, if you specified a particular index, you may use this value from the dropdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HTTP Source</td>
<td>The Splunk <code>source</code> name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IP</td>
<td>The IP address whose traffic you want to inspect. This maps to <code>data.ip</code> in the log event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client</td>
<td>The client whose traffic you want to inspect. This maps to <code>data.client_name</code> in the log event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Country</td>
<td>The country whose traffic you want to inspect. This is a field obtained using the <code>iplocation data.ip</code> search command in the query. It results in a <code>Country</code> field being added to each log event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Username</td>
<td>The email address whose login traffic you want to inspect. This maps to <code>data.user_name</code> in the log event.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
