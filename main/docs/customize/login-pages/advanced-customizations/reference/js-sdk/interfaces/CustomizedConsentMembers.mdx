<RequestExample>

```typescript Interface lines
export interface CustomizedConsentMembers extends BaseMembers {
  /**
   * Provides access to the specific properties and data of the Customized Consent screen,
   * including the list of `scopes` and `authorizationDetails` being requested.
   * @type {ScreenMembersOnCustomizedConsent}
   */
  screen: ScreenMembersOnCustomizedConsent;

  /**
   * Submits the user's decision to accept (grant) the requested permissions and authorization details.
   * This action posts to the `/u/customized-consent` endpoint with `action: "accept"`.
   * The transaction state is automatically included.
   *
   * @param {CustomOptions} [payload] - Optional. An object for any custom key-value pairs
   *                                    to be sent with the request. These parameters will be
   *                                    included in the form data submitted to the server.
   * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the accept action is successfully submitted.
   *                          On success, Auth0 typically redirects the user back to the application
   *                          or to the next step in the authentication flow.
   * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the form submission fails (e.g., network issue, invalid state).
   *                 Server-side errors (like "invalid_request") will be reflected in `this.transaction.errors`
   *                 after the operation, rather than being thrown as JavaScript errors.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Assuming 'customizedConsentManager' is an instance of the CustomizedConsent SDK class
   * try {
   *   await customizedConsentManager.accept();
   *   // If successful, the page will typically redirect.
   * } catch (error) {
   *   // Handle unexpected errors during the submission itself.
   *   console.error("Failed to submit consent acceptance:", error);
   * }
   * // After the await, check customizedConsentManager.transaction.errors for server-side validation issues.
   * ```
   */
  accept(payload?: CustomOptions): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Submits the user's decision to deny (reject) the requested permissions and authorization details.
   * This action posts to the `/u/customized-consent` endpoint with `action: "deny"`.
   * The transaction state is automatically included.
   *
   * @param {CustomOptions} [payload] - Optional. An object for any custom key-value pairs

   * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the deny action is successfully submitted.
   *                          On success, Auth0 typically redirects the user, potentially showing an
   *                          access denied message or returning an error to the application.
   * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the form submission fails (e.g., network issue, invalid state).
   *                 Server-side errors are reflected in `this.transaction.errors`.

   *   // If successful, the page will typically redirect.
   * } catch (error) {
