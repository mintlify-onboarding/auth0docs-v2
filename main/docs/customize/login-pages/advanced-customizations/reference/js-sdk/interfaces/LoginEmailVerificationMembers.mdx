title: "LoginEmailVerificationMembers"
description: "@interface LoginEmailVerificationMembers description Defines the members (properties and methods) available for interacting with the Login Email Verification screen. This screen is a crucial part of email verification processes, typically during login, where a user must prove ownership of an email address by providing a one-time code. The SDK facilitates submitting this code or requesting a new one. The `universal_login_context` for this screen (`window.universal_login_context`) will contain: - `client`: Information about the Auth0 application. - `organization` (optional): Details if the authentication is for a specific organization. - `prompt`: Context of the current authentication prompt (e.g., 'login'). - `screen`: UI texts and general screen information. No screen-specific `data` fields are uniquely defined for `login-email-verification` beyond standard ones. - `transaction`: Details of the ongoing transaction, including state and any errors from previous attempts (e.g., \"invalid-code\")."

<RequestExample>

```typescript Interface lines
export interface LoginEmailVerificationMembers extends BaseMembers {
  /**
   * Submits the email verification code entered by the user.
   * This action corresponds to the user entering the code they received via email and
   * clicking a "Continue" or "Verify" button. The SDK will then POST this code
   * to the Auth0 `/u/login-email-verification` endpoint.
   *
   * If the code is valid, Auth0 will typically redirect the user to the next step in the
   * authentication flow. If the code is invalid, expired, or another error occurs,
   * Auth0 will usually re-render the login-email-verification screen, and the
   * `transaction.errors` array in the SDK's context will be updated with details
   * about the failure (e.g., error code `invalid-code`).
   *
   * @param {ContinueWithCodeOptions} payload - An object containing the `code` string entered by the user.
   *                                            It can also include any `CustomOptions` for extensibility.
   * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the form submission is initiated.
   *                          It does not return data directly upon resolution, as a redirect or
   *                          page re-render is the common outcome.
   * @throws {Error} Throws an error if `payload.code` is not provided or is not a string,
   *                 or if the `FormHandler` encounters an unrecoverable issue during submission (e.g., network error).
   *                 Validation errors from Auth0 (like an invalid code) are not thrown as JavaScript errors
   *                 but are reflected in `this.transaction.errors` after the operation.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Assuming 'manager' is an instance of LoginEmailVerification
   * const userInputCode = "123456";
   * try {
   *   await manager.continueWithCode({ code: userInputCode });
   *   // If successful, page redirects. No further client-side action needed here.
   * } catch (error) {
   *   // This catch is for unexpected errors, not for Auth0 validation errors.
   *   console.error("Failed to submit the verification code:", error);
   * }
   * // After the await, always check manager.transaction.errors for server-side validation issues.
   * if (manager.transaction.errors && manager.transaction.errors.length > 0) {
   *   manager.transaction.errors.forEach(err => {
   *     if (err.code === 'invalid-code') {
   *       // Display "The code you entered is invalid" to the user.
   *     }
   *   });
   * }
   * ```
   */
  continueWithCode(payload: ContinueWithCodeOptions): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Requests a new verification code to be sent to the user's email address.
   * This action is typically invoked when the user clicks a "Resend Code" button, perhaps because
   * they didn't receive the first email, the code expired, or they suspect an issue.
   * The SDK will POST to the Auth0 `/u/login-email-verification` endpoint with an action indicating
   * a resend request.
   *
   * Upon successful submission of this request, Auth0 attempts to send a new email.
   * The page may re-render. If there are issues (e.g., too many resend attempts for the same email,
   * identified by error code `too-many-emails`), `transaction.errors` will be updated.
   *
   * @param {ResendCodeOptions} [payload] - Optional. An object for `CustomOptions` if any
   *                                        additional parameters need to be sent with the request.
   * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the resend request is initiated.
   *                          Like `continueWithCode`, this usually results in a page re-render or state update
   *                          rather than direct data in the promise resolution.
   * @throws {Error} Throws if the `FormHandler` encounters an unrecoverable issue (e.g., network error).
   *                 Server-side errors (like rate limits) are reflected in `this.transaction.errors`.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Assuming 'manager' is an instance of LoginEmailVerification
   * try {
   *   await manager.resendCode();
   *   // Optionally, update UI to inform the user a new code has been sent.
   *   alert("A new verification code has been dispatched to your email.");
   * } catch (error) {
   *   console.error("Failed to request a new code:", error);
   * }
   * // After the await, check manager.transaction.errors for server-side issues.
   * if (manager.transaction.errors && manager.transaction.errors.length > 0) {
   *   manager.transaction.errors.forEach(err => {
   *     if (err.code === 'too-many-emails') {
   *       // Display "You have requested too many emails. Please wait a few minutes."
   *     }
   *   });
   * }
   * ```

  resendCode(payload?: ResendCodeOptions): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Gets resend functionality with timeout management for this screen
   * @param options Configuration options for resend functionality
   */
  resendManager(options?: StartResendOptions): ResendControl;
