title: "MfaPollingOptions"
description: "Configuration options for managing an MFA push-notification polling process. Supply these options when starting a polling session to control how often the challenge endpoint is queried and how success or failure is handled."
---

## Type Definition

```typescript
type MfaPollingOptions = {
  /**
   * Optional interval, in **milliseconds**, between consecutive polling requests.
   *
   * - If omitted, the SDK’s internal default interval is used (typically 5000 ms).
   * - Choose a value that balances responsiveness with rate-limit considerations.
   *
   * @defaultValue Implementation-specific (commonly 5000 ms)
   */
  intervalMs?: number;

  /**
   * Optional callback executed once the MFA push challenge is successfully
   * approved and polling completes.
   *
   * - Called exactly **once**, after which polling stops automatically.
   * - Useful for advancing the login flow (e.g., calling `continue()`).
   */
  onCompleted?: () => void;

  /**
   * Optional callback invoked if an error occurs while polling.
   *
   * Receives an {@link ULError} object containing:
   * - `status` — the HTTP status code from the failed request
   * - `responseText` — the raw response body, if available
   *
   * - Called once per error event; polling may retry depending on error type.
   * - Use to surface error messages or trigger custom retry/abort logic.
   */
  onError?: (error: ULError) => void;
};
```
