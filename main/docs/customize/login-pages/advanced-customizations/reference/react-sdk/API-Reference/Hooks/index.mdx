## Functions

- [useAuth0Themes](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useAuth0Themes): React hook to get the current theme options with flattened configuration from branding context.
- [useCurrentScreen](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useCurrentScreen): React hook that gets the current screen context and state.
- [useErrors](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useErrors): React hook for reading and managing errors in ACUL (Advanced Customization of Universal Login). With all validation and server-side errors. It groups errors into three kinds: - `server` — errors returned by Auth0 or your own backend. - `client` — errors from client-side validation (e.g., invalid form input). - `developer` — errors caused by incorrect integration or SDK misuse.
- [useLoginIdentifiers](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useLoginIdentifiers): Returns a list of active identifier types (such as `'email'`, `'phone'`, or `'username'`) currently in use in the authentication flow or login process.
- [useMfaPolling](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useMfaPolling): React hook to manage MFA push polling (e.g., waiting for a push notification approval) on an Auth0 Advanced Customization of Universal Login (ACUL) screen.
- [useResend](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useResend): This React hook manages "resend" actions (e.g., resending a verification code) on ACUL screens.
- [useSignupIdentifiers](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useSignupIdentifiers): Returns a list of enabled identifiers (email, phone, or username), each with its `required` status, based on the current screen's signup identifiers.
- [usePasswordValidation](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/usePasswordValidation): This React hook validates a password against the current Auth0 password policy and returns a structured result describing whether the password satisfies each rule.
- [useUsernameValidation](/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations/reference/react-sdk/API-Reference/Hooks/functions/useUsernameValidation): React hook for validating a username against the current Auth0 username policy.
