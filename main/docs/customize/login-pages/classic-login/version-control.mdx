You can use version control software to manage the source code of your Classic Login pages. Using version control for your content may be especially beneficial if you use a CI/CD flow for your tenant configuration and have customized the HTML of one or more Classic Login pages.

To implement version control, use the Auth0 Marketplace integration for your preferred method:

* [GitLab Pipelines](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/gitlab-pipeline)
* [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/github-actions)
* [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/bitbucket-pipeline)
* [Microsoft Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/azure-pipeline)

The general deployment process requires the following steps:

1. Create a folder in your version control repository with the appropriate name (`pages`).
2. Create an HTML page (`login.html`, `password_reset.html`, `guardian_multifactor.html`, or `error_page.html`) within that folder.
3. Create a JSON file with the same name as your HTML page for each hosted page that you wish to source control. To enable the page, the JSON file needs to contain the following:

`{
"enabled": true
}`

For example:
`your-repo/pages/error_page.html
your-repo/pages/error_page.json`
