The Private Cloud packages are managed services that you can use if you:

* Cannot use a multi-tenant Public Cloud service in your organization
* Have geographical deployment requirements where the Public Cloud option isn't feasible
* Require a guaranteed level of requests per second (RPS) or higher capacity than available on Public Cloud

The Auth0 private cloud can be deployed in the following ways:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Option</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud/private-cloud-on-aws"><strong>Private Cloud on AWS</strong></a></td>
<td>A dedicated, managed cloud service running on AWS providing isolation, higher performance, dev instances, Geo-HA add-ons and more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/docs/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud/private-cloud-on-azure"><strong>Private Cloud on Azure</strong></a></td>
<td>A dedicated cloud service running on Azure providing isolation, higher performance, dev instances, add-ons and more</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
