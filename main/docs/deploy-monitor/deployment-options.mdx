Auth0 provides both public cloud and private cloud deployment options and tools to help you with your Enterprise deployment.

The Auth0 identity platform can be deployed in the following ways:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Option</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Public Cloud</strong></td>
<td>A multi-tenant cloud service running on Auth0's cloud with standard authentication, personalization, user management, and security features</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud/private-cloud-on-aws"><strong>Private Cloud on AWS</strong></a></td>
<td>A dedicated, managed cloud service running on AWS providing isolation, higher performance, dev instances, Geo-HA add-ons and more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/deploy-monitor/deploy-private-cloud/private-cloud-on-azure"><strong>Private Cloud on Azure</strong></a></td>

The **Private Cloud** packages are managed services that you can use if you:

* Cannot use a multi-tenant public cloud service in your organization
* Require a guaranteed level of requests per second (RPS)
