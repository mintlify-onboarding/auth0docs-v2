---
You can use the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> to retrieve up to 100 logs per request using the [/get_logs](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/#!/Logs/get_logs) endpoint, which supports two types of consumption:

* **By checkpoint**: Recommended if you want to export logs to the external data analytics service.
* **By search criteria**: Used by the Dashboard.

Logs stored by Auth0 are subject to a retention period that is based on your Auth0 subscription. To learn more, read [Log Data Retention](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/log-data-retention).

You can also use these endpoints to look for logs:

* `/api/v2/logs/{id}`: Retrieves the single log entry associated with the provided log ID.
* `/api/v2/users/{user_id}/logs`: Retrieves logs for a specific user ID.

## Retrieve logs by checkpoint

This method allows you to retrieve logs newer than a given `log_id`. It
is commonly used to send your Logs to an external system, such as Splunk, Datadog,
Application Insights, Mixpanel, and more.

To search by checkpoint, use the following parameters:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Parameter</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>from</code></td>
<td>Log event ID to start retrieving logs. You can limit the amount of logs using the <code>take</code> parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>take</code></td>
<td>The total amount of entries to retrieve when using the <code>from</code> parameter.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Any parameter other than `from` and `take` will be ignored. The logs are ordered by the `log_id`.

#### Semantics

Retrieving logs by checkpoint has the following semantics:

* All logs available to your role's permissions will be returned
* The logs are ordered by the `log_id`, rather than log generation time, to prevent skipping past records due to Auth0 system delays
* Pagination is unbounded, meaning there is no limit, in contrast to the `1,000` record limit when retrieving logs by search criteria

#### Pagination

When retrieving logs by checkpoint, only the first request should be made
manually. Each subsequent request should be made using the `next` relation URL
inside of the `Link` header. This simplifies the work for integrating with the
API, and allows Auth0 to make optimizations without impacting the customer
experience.

#### Example

Let's assume your tenant name in the `us` is `acme`. To start retrieving records by
checkpoint:

1. Grab the `log_id` from any log in your system.
   Example: `90020211201185132572079310688835925971249535794074878050`.
2. Make a request to `https://TENANT_NAME.LOCALITY.auth0.com/api/v2/logs?from=LOG_ID&take=100` to request the next `100` logs newer than the given `LOG_ID`.
3. The HTTP response will contain

   1. A JSON array of `0` to `100` logs newer than the given `LOG_ID`
   2. An HTTP `Link` header with a `next` relation
4. If the result set is empty you will receive an empty array, and the `next` relation will match the same URL you used in the most recent request

## Retrieve logs by search criteria

This method allows you to retrieve logs that match the specified search criteria or, if no criteria is used, lists all logs. To search by criteria use the following parameters:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>Search criteria using Query String Syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>page</code></td>
<td>The zero-based page number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>per_page</code></td>
<td>The number of entries per page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>sort</code></td>
<td>The field to use for sorting. Use <code>field:order</code>, where <code>order</code> is <code>1</code> for ascending and <code>-1</code> for descending. For example <code>date:-1</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fields</code></td>
<td>A comma-separated field list to include or exclude (depending on <code>include_fields</code>) from the result. Leave empty to retrieve all fields.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>include_fields</code></td>
<td><code>true</code> if the fields specified are to be included in the result, <code>false</code> otherwise. Defaults to <code>true</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To see a list of fields and sort parameters that can be used in the search query, read [Log Search Query Syntax](/docs/deploy-monitor/logs/log-search-query-syntax).

## Limitations

Besides the limitation of 100 logs per request to retrieve logs, you may only paginate through up to 1,000 search results.

If you get the error `414 Request-URI Too Large` this means that your query string is larger than the supported length. In this case, refine your search.

<Card title="Private Cloud search field limitations">

The following fields are searchable only for Private Cloud:

* `user`
* `connection`
* `application`
* `type`
* `ip`

Use double quotes for exact searches (e.g., `application:"test"` will search for all log events specific to the application named `test`, but `application:test` will search log events for applications with "test" in their name.
