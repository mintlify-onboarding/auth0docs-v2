You can monitor Auth0 as a standard web application using System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or any tool that supports synthetic transactions. We recommend adding a synthetic login transaction that includes the extensions your applications rely on (such as rules that execute custom code for integration with your company's other services).

## Set up SCOM

1. Add a new SCOM instance using the **Add Monitoring Wizard**:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Description name for the SCOM instance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Description of what this SCOM instance monitors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Select destination management pack</td>
<td>Default Management Pack</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   When finished, click **Next** to continue.
   
2. Click **Add** to enter the URLs you want SCOM to monitor. When finished, click **Next** to continue.

3. Click **Add** to set up a location from which you want to monitor.

4. In the pop-up dialog, search for **Internal location - Agent**. Select the appropriate address, and click **Add**. Then click **Ok** to finish selecting the location. When finished, click **Next** to continue.
5. Set the frequency with which SCOM collects data from each endpoint:


<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Data</th>
<th>Frequency</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Test frequency</td>
<td>60 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance data collection interval</td>
<td>60 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test time-out</td>
<td>30 seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HTTP status code</td>
<td>Greater than or equals 400</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
6. When finished, click **Next** to continue.

## Run SCOM tests

1. Click **Run Test** to test each endpoint and ensure that the connection settings provided are correct.
2. Once you have finished configuring your SCOM instance, you can view activity through the **Monitoring** tab.

## Review test results

Click **Web Application Status** to bring up the information SCOM has gathered.
