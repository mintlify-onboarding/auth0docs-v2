The [OIDC](/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol)-conformant authentication pipeline supports defining <Tooltip tip="Resource Server: Server hosting protected resources. Resource servers accept and respond to protected resource requests." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=resource+servers">resource servers</Tooltip> (such as APIs) as entities separate from applications. This lets you decouple APIs from the applications that consume them, and also lets you define [third-party applications](/docs/get-started/applications/confidential-and-public-applications/first-party-and-third-party-applications) that allow external parties to securely access protected resources behind your API.

## Consent dialog

If a user authenticates through a third-party application and the application requests authorization to access the user's information or perform some action at an API on their behalf, the user will see a consent dialog.

For example, this request:

```http lines
GET /authorize?
client_id=some_third_party_client
&redirect_uri=https://fabrikam.com/contoso_social
&response_type=token id_token
&__scope=openid profile email read:posts write:posts__
&__audience=https://social.contoso.com__
&nonce=...
&state=...
```

Will result in this user consent dialog:

<Frame>![Authorization - User consent and applications - consent-dialog](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/5Cz3aZKw8RRVlMkc5Zl6x7/62ac54cbc470286d5c2139d47c604ebc/2025-02-28_14-57-52.png)</Frame>

If the user allows the application's request, this creates a user grant, which represents the user's consent to this combination of application, resource server, and requested scopes. The application then receives a successful authentication response from Auth0 as usual.

Once consent has been given, the user won't see the consent dialog during subsequent logins until consent is revoked explicitly.

## Scope descriptions

By default, the consent page will use the scopes' names to prompt for the user's consent. As shown below, you should define scopes using the **action:resource_name** format.

<Frame>![Authorization - User consent and applications - Consent scopes](/docs/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/3Z4Ofbj5yF7eg5cLfcauh9/556bab9e627b0ff68b20664d149f1483/Blog_API_Permissions_-_English.png)</Frame>

The consent page groups scopes for the same resource and displays all actions for that resource in a single line. For example, the configuration above would result in **Posts: read and write your posts**.

If you would like to display the **Description** field instead, you can do so by setting the tenant's **use_scope_descriptions_for_consent** to **true**. This will affect consent prompts for all of the APIs on that tenant.

To set the **use_scope_descriptions_for_consent** flag, you will need to make the appropriate call to the API:

<AuthCodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/tenants/settings' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer API2_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{ "flags": { "use_scope_descriptions_for_consent": true } }'
```
```csharp C#

var request = new RestRequest(Method.PATCH);
request.AddHeader("content-type", "application/json");
request.AddHeader("authorization", "Bearer API2_ACCESS_TOKEN");
request.AddHeader("cache-control", "no-cache");
request.AddParameter("application/json", "{ "flags": { "use_scope_descriptions_for_consent": true } }", ParameterType.RequestBody);
IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
```

	req.Header.Add("content-type", "application/json")
	req.Header.Add("authorization", "Bearer API2_ACCESS_TOKEN")
	req.Header.Add("cache-control", "no-cache")

	res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

	defer res.Body.Close()
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

	fmt.Println(res)
	fmt.Println(string(body))

## Handle rejected permissions

If a user decides to reject consent to the application, they will be redirected to the `redirect_uri` specified in the request with an `access_denied` error:

```http lines
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://fabrikam.com/contoso_social#
    error=access_denied
    &state=...
```

## Skip consent for first-party applications

First-party applications can skip the consent dialog, but only if the API they are trying to access on behalf of the user has the **Allow Skipping User Consent** option enabled.

To navigate to the **Allow Skipping User Consent** toggle, select **Applications > APIs > (select the api) > Settings > Access Settings.**

<Card title="User consent and applications">

Note that this option only allows verifiable first-party applications to skip consent at the moment. As `localhost` is never a verifiable first-party (because any malicious application may run on `localhost` for a user), Auth0 will always display the consent dialog for applications running on `localhost` regardless of whether they are marked as first-party applications. During development, you can work around this by modifying your `/etc/hosts` file to add an entry such as the following:

`127.0.0.1 myapp.example`

Similarly, you cannot skip consent (even for first-party applications) if `localhost` is used in the application's `redirect_uri` parameter and is present in any of the application's **Allowed Callback URLs** (found in <AuthLink href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings">Dashboard > Applications > Settings</AuthLink>).

</Card>

Since third-party applications are assumed to be untrusted, they are not able to skip consent dialogs.

## Revoke consent

If a user has provided consent but you would like to revoke it:

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > User Management > Users](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users), and click the user for whom you would like to revoke consent.
2. Click the **Authorized Applications** tab,
3. Click **Revoke** next to the appropriate application.

## Password-based flows

When using the [Resource Owner Password Flow](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/resource-owner-password-flow), no consent dialog is involved because the user directly provides their password to the application, which is equivalent to granting the application full access to the user's account.

## Force users to provide consent

When redirecting to the `/authorize` endpoint, including the `prompt=consent` parameter will force users to provide consent, even if they have an existing user grant for the application and requested scopes.
