To use Highly Regulated Identity features, you must have an Enterprise Plan with the Highly Regulated Identity add-on. Refer to [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/) for details.

To help customers configure their Auth0 tenant to adhere to one of the Financial-grade API (FAPI) profiles, the Application model includes a `compliance_level` property that can be set to one of three values:

* `null` or undefined: No compliance level is required. This is the default.
* `fapi1_adv_mtls_par`: The customer would like this client to behave in accordance with the FAPI1 Advanced profile using [mTLS](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-mtls) and [PAR](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-par).
* `fapi1_adv_pkj_par`: The customer would like this client to behave in accordance with the FAPI1 Advanced profile using [Private Key JWT](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-private-key-jwt) and [PAR](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-par).

Complying with a FAPI profile requires a number of configuration changes. Setting the `compliance_level` ensures that no authorization request can succeed unless the request and the configuration is compliant with the selected standard.

For example, both the `fapi1_adv_pkj_par` and `fapi1_adv_mtls_par` compliance levels require PAR. If either of these compliance levels are selected, PAR is required regardless of the value of the `require_pushed_authorization_requests` setting. Attempting an authorization without using PAR results in the following error response:

```json lines
{
  “error”: “invalid_request”,
  “error_description”: “Pushed Authorization Requests are required by the configured compliance level” 
}
```






In some cases, setting a compliance level also changes Auth0’s behavior. For example, both the `fapi1_adv_pkj_par` and `fapi1_adv_mtls_par` compliance levels cause Auth0 to include a `s_hash` claim in the returned <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+token">ID token</Tooltip> containing a SHA256 hash of the state value. This allows the ID tokens to act as a detached signature.

The following tables summarize the additional validation rules and changes to Auth0’s behavior that each compliance level enables:

<table class="table"><thead>

## Configure FAPI Compliance for a client

<Tabs><Tab title="Auth0 Dashboard">

To perform this using the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Auth0 Dashboard > Applications**.
2. Select the application.
3. Select the **Application Settings** tab.
4. Open the **Advanced Settings** section.
5. In the **OAuth tab**, select the **FAPI Compliance Enforcement Level**.

The options to configure FAPI compliance are:

* **None**: No compliance level is required. This is the default.
* **FAPI 1 Advanced profile using Private Key JWT and PAR**: The customer would like this client to behave in accordance with the FAPI1 Advanced profile using [Private Key JWT](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-private-key-jwt) and [PAR](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-par).
* **FAPI 1 Advanced profile using mTLS and PAR**: The customer would like this client to behave in accordance with the FAPI1 Advanced profile using [mTLS](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-mtls) and [PAR](/docs/get-started/applications/configure-par).

</Tab><Tab title="Management API">

Use the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) to set the `compliance_level` property with a POST or PATCH request:

```bash lines
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "compliance_level": "fapi1_adv_mtls_par"
}'
```






To return the `compliance_level` property, use a GET request:

```bash lines
curl --location 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token'
```
