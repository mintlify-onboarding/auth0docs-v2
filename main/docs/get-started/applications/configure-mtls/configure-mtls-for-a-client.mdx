'twitter:title': Configure mTLS Authentication for a Client
---
Learn how to configure mTLS authentication for a client with the [Management API](#configure-mtls-with-management-api) and [Auth0 Dashboard](#configure-mtls-with-auth0-dashboard).

<Tabs><Tab title="Auth0 Dashboard">

You can use the Auth0 Dashboard to configure mTLS for a client to enable mTLS client authentication to the Authorization Server.

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications).
2. Select the application you want to use with mTLS or [create a new application](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications).
3. Select the **Credentials** tab.
4. Choose the required **Authentication Method**, which can be either:

   * mTLS with a [self-signed certificate](/docs/customize/custom-domains/self-managed-certificates)
   * mTLS with a certificate authority signed certificate
5. Once you select your preferred type of certificate, you can:

   * Assign an existing credential (certificate) to the client application
   * Add a new credential by uploading a certificate

</Tab><Tab title="Management API">

Use the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) to configure mTLS for a client.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

The following examples specify **$management_access_token**, or a [Management API access token](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/management-api-access-tokens). This must be replaced with an access token that contains at least the following scopes:

* `create:custom_domains`
* `read:custom_domains`
* `create:clients`
* `update:clients`
* `update:client_credentials`
* `update:client_keys`
* `update:tenant_settings`

To learn more about retrieving an access token with the required scopes, read [Get Access Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/get-access-tokens).

</Callout>

#### Self-signed certificates

Use self-signed certificates to verify the client’s identity during mTLS authentication. However, self-signed certificates have the following limitations

* Self-signed certificates are not accepted by some cloud providers such as Amazon.
* To ensure the stability of our platform, Auth0 limits customers to two registered certificates.

##### Generate a certificate

To authenticate using self-signed mTLS, you must create a new self-signed client certificate.

The following code sample generates a new self-signed certificate:

```bash wrap lines
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=XX/ST=StateName/L=CityName/O=CompanyName/OU=CompanySectionName/CN=CommonNameOrHostname"
```






If using curl or Wget, the PEM certificate must be JSON escaped before you pass it to Auth0. For example, replace a newline is with `\r\n`:

```bash wrap lines

```






##### Create a new client

To create a new client, make a POST call to the [`/clients`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/post-clients) endpoint with the following payload:

* `$client_name`**:** the name for the new client
* `$credential_name`**:** the name for the public key
* `$credential_certificate`: the content of `$certificate_pem`generated in the previous step

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "$client_name",
  "app_type": "non_interactive",
  "client_authentication_methods": {
    "self_signed_tls_client_auth": {
      "credentials": [{ 
        "name": "$credential_name", 
        "credential_type": "x509_cert", 
        "pem": "$credential_certificate"
      }]
    }
  },
  "jwt_configuration": {
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
}'
```






For more information, see the [Create a client](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/post-clients) API documentation.

##### Patch an existing client

You can update an existing client to accept mTLS client authentication by removing any value in the `token_endpoint_auth_method` field and creating values in the `client_authentication_methods` field.

<Warning>

Once you have configured your client for mTLS, you won't be able to authenticate using the Client Secret unless you configure the `token_endpoint_auth_method` to stop using mTLS. To learn more, read [Revert a client to use a Client Secret](#revert-a-client-to-use-a-client-secret).

</Warning>

##### Create the credential resource

After you generate a certificate, create the credential resource:

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id/credentials' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "$credential_name", 
  "credential_type": "x509_cert", 
  "pem": "$credential_certificate"
}'
```






Auth0 returns a credential ID in the response that you will need to associate the credential with the client.

For more information, see the [Create a client credential](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/post-credentials) API documentation.

##### Associate the credential with the client and disable `token_endpoint_auth_method`

Uploaded credentials are not automatically enabled for client authentication. You need to update the client authentication to use the new self-signed client certificate.

The following PATCH request sets the `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `null`, thus disabling Client Secret authentication. It also updates `client_authentication_methods` with the credential ID:

```bash lines
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": null, 
  "client_authentication_methods": {
    "self_signed_tls_client_auth": {
      "credentials": [{ "id": $credential.id }]
    }
  }
}'
```






Once this request has completed, a Client Secret will no longer be accepted and clients must authenticate using mTLS.

For more information, see the [Update a client](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id) API documentation.

#### Certificate authority signed certificates

Unlike self-signed certificates that are generated by the client and have no trust chain, certificate authority (CA) signed certificates are considered more trustworthy since they are issued by a trusted third party. CA-signed certificates are the only type of certificate accepted by some cloud providers such as Amazon.

CA-signed certificates have embedded in their identity information the notion of a Distinguished Name (DN). While each individual certificate created by a given CA is unique, they can share a common DN. When using CA-signed certificates, Auth0 stores the DN and compares forwarded client certificates with registered DNs.

##### Generate a certificate

The method of generating a CA-signed client certificate is highly dependent on the Public Key Infrastructure and outside of the scope of this document. We recommend generating at least a [2048-bit RSA key pair](/docs/secure/application-credentials/generate-rsa-key-pair).

##### Create a new client

To create a client, make a POST call to the [`/clients`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/post-clients) endpoint with the following payload:

* `$client_name`**:** the name for the new client
* `$credential_name`**:** the name for the public key
* `$credential_certificate`: the content of `$certificate_pem`generated by the CA

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "$client_name",
  "app_type": "non_interactive",
  "client_authentication_methods": {
    "tls_client_auth": {
      "credentials": [{ 
        "name": "$credential_name", 
        "credential_type": "cert_subject_dn", 
        "pem": "$credential_certificate"
      }]
    }
  },
  "jwt_configuration": {
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
}'
```






Instead of passing the full PEM file, you can also pass the subject DN. The subject DN must match the extracted Distinguished Name (DN) of the client certificates sent during the mTLS handshake.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

Subject DN extraction may differ between different ecosystems. The most reliable way to guarantee that the authorization server will match the subject DN is to upload the whole PEM file.

</Callout>

The following POST request creates a new client with the subject DN:

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "$client_name",
  "app_type": "non_interactive",
  "client_authentication_methods": {
    "tls_client_auth": {
      "credentials": [{ 
        "name": "$credential_name", 
        "credential_type": "cert_subject_dn", 
        "subject_dn": "C=XX\nST=StateName\nL=CityName\nO=CompanyName\nOU=CompanySectionName\nCN=CommonNameOrHostname"
      }]
    }
  },
  "jwt_configuration": {
    "alg": "RS256"
  }
}'
```






For more information, see the [Create a client](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/post-clients) API documentation.

##### Patch an existing client

If you don’t want to create a new client to use mTLS, you can update an existing client to accept mTLS client authentication. This involves removing any value in the `token_endpoint_auth_method` field and creating values in the `client_authentication_methods` field.

<Warning>

Once you have configured your client for mTLS, you won't be able to authenticate using the Client Secret unless you configure the `token_endpoint_auth_method` to stop using mTLS. To learn more, read [Revert a client to use a Client Secret](#revert-a-client-to-use-a-client-secret).

</Warning>

##### Create the credential resource

Once you have [generated a key pair](/docs/secure/application-credentials/generate-rsa-key-pair) exclusively for mTLS, create the credential resource. Make the following POST request to the `/clients` endpoint:

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id/credentials' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "$credential_name", 
  "credential_type": "cert_subject_dn", 
  "pem": "$credential_certificate"
}'
```






Instead of passing the full PEM file, you can pass the subject DN. The subject DN must match the extracted Distinguished Name (DN) of the client certificates sent during the mTLS handshake.

The following code sample creates the credential resource using the Subject DN:

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id/credentials' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "$credential_name", 
  "credential_type": "cert_subject_dn", 
  "subject_dn": "C=XX\nST=StateName\nL=CityName\nO=CompanyName\nOU=CompanySectionName\nCN=CommonNameOrHostname"
}'
```






When using either method, remember that the credential ID that gets returned in the response is needed to associate the credential with the client.

For more information, see the [Create a client credential](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/post-credentials) API documentation.

##### Associate the credential with the client and disable `token_endpoint_auth_method`

Although we have created the credential, we have not yet associated the credential with the client.

To do so, update  `client_authentication_methods` by making the following PATCH request to the `/clients` endpoint. In the same request, set `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `null`:

​​

```bash lines
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": null, 
  "client_authentication_methods": {
    "tls_client_auth": {
      "credentials": [{ "id": $credential.id }]
    }
  }
}'
```






Once this request has completed, the client can only be authenticated using mTLS.

For more information, see the [Update a client](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id) API documentation.

#### Revert a client to use a Client Secret

To restore your client’s configuration to authenticate using a Client Secret, disable `client_authentication_methods` and re-enable `token_endpoint_auth_method` with your desired authentication method.

In the following PATCH request, set `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `client_secret_post` to re-enable Client Secret authentication:

```bash lines
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://$tenant/api/v2/clients/$client_id' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $management_access_token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post", 
  "client_authentication_methods": null
}'
```






For more information, see the [Update a client](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/clients/patch-clients-by-id) API documentation.
