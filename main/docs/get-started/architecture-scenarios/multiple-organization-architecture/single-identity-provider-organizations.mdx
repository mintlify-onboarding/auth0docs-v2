In the Single <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Identity+Provider">Identity Provider</Tooltip> (IdP) Organizations scenario, every organization that uses the [Auth0 Organizations](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview) feature uses exactly one Auth0 connection. This feature allows each application to select the appropriate organization defined on the Auth0 Tenant, which will either authenticate user credentials directly or forward the authentication request to the appropriate IdP to handle.

In this scenario, we’ll continue to use the [Travel0 Corporate Booking](/docs/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture) example. In this example, the corporate booking application equates to your application and Travel0 corresponds to your company.

<Warning>

The Auth0 Organizations feature currently supports applications that use the [SAML](/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-configuration), [Open ID Connect](/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol) protocols and/or the [OAuth 2](/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth) framework. Applications that require [WS-Fed](/docs/authenticate/protocols/ws-fed-protocol) are not supported.

</Warning>

Regardless of how credentials are processed--whether user credentials are stored in a database connection (like with Hoekstra & Associates) or are validated via an enterprise connection (like with MetaHexa Bank) or a social connection--your application behaves the same way. Leveraging the [Organizations](/docs/manage-users/organizations/organizations-overview) feature allows you to configure and control the experience.
