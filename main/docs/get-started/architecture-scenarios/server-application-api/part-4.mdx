In the [Server + API Architecture Scenario](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/server-application-api), we covered a simple, machine-to-machine scenario: an API, used to import timesheet entries in ExampleCo's systems, and a cron job, used by external contractors to send in their timesheets using this API.

We learned about the Client Credentials Grant and <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=access+tokens">access tokens</Tooltip>, how to configure an API in Auth0, how to configure a Machine-to-Machine Application to communicate securely with this API, how to define and secure our API endpoints, how to use the provided libraries to validate the access token and how to retrieve a new one from Auth0.

We used Node.js for the API implementation and Python for the non-interactive server process. We hope this examples empowers you to build your own implementation with your preferred technologies.
