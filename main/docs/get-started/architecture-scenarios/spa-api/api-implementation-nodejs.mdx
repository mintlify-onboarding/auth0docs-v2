# Node.js API Implementation (SPAs + API)

This document is part of the SPA + API Architecture Scenario and it explains how to implement the API in Node.js. Please refer to the scenario for information on the implemented solution.

The full source code for the Node.js API implementation can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-pnp-exampleco-timesheets/tree/master/timesheets-api/node).

## Step 1. Define the API endpoints

We will use the [Express web application framework](http://expressjs.com/) to build our Node.js API.

### Create a package.json File

Create a folder for your API, navigate into it and run `npm init`. This will setup your `package.json` file.

You can leave the default settings or change them as you see fit.

Our sample's `package.json` looks like the following:

```json lines
{
  "name": "timesheets-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "API used to add timesheet entries for employees and contractors",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-pnp-timesheets.git"
  },
  "author": "Auth0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-pnp-timesheets/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-pnp-timesheets#readme"
}
```






### Install the Dependencies

Next, we need to set our dependencies. We will use the following modules:

* **express**: This module adds the [Express web application framework](https://expressjs.com/).
* **cors**: This module adds support for enabling [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) which is required since the API will be called from a Single-Page Application running on a different domain inside a web browser.
* **jwks-rsa**: This library retrieves RSA signing keys from a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint. Using `expressJwtSecret` we can generate a secret provider that will provide the right signing key to `express-jwt` based on the `kid` in the <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip> header. For more information refer to the [node-jwks-rsa GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa).
* **express-jwt**: This module lets you authenticate HTTP requests using JWT tokens in your Node.js applications. It provides several functions that make working with JWTs easier. For more information refer to the [express-jwt GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt).
* **body-parser**: This is a Node.js body parsing middleware. It extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on `req.body` as something easier to interface with.For more information and several alternatives refer to the body-parser GitHub repository.

To install these dependencies run the following:

```bash wrap lines
npm install express cors express-jwt jwks-rsa body-parser express-jwt-authz --save
```






### Implement the Endpoints

Navigate to your API directory and create a `server.js` file. Your code needs to:

* Get the dependencies.
* Implement the endpoint(s).
* Launch the API server.

This is our sample implementation:

```javascript lines
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { expressjwt: jwt } = require('express-jwt');
const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa');
const cors = require('cors');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

// Enable CORS
app.use(cors());

// Enable the use of request body parsing middleware
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  extended: true
}));

// Create timesheets API endpoint
app.post('/timesheets', function(req, res){
  res.status(201).send({message: "This is the POST /timesheets endpoint"});
})

// Launch the API Server at localhost:8080
app.listen(8080);
```






Launch your API server using `node server` and make an HTTP POST request to `localhost:8080/timesheets`. You should see a JSON response with the message `This is the POST /timesheets endpoint`.

So now we have our endpoint but anyone can call it. Continue to the next paragraph to see how we can fix this.

## Step 2. Secure the API endpoints

In order to validate our token we will use the `jwt` function, provided by the [express-jwt middleware](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt#usage), and the `jwks-rsa` to retrieve our secret. The libraries do the following:

1. `express-jwt` will decode the token and pass the request, the header and the payload to `jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret`.
2. `jwks-rsa` will then download all signing keys from the JWKS endpoint and see if a one of the signing keys matches the `kid` in the header of the JWT. If none of the signing keys match the incoming `kid`, an error will be thrown. If we have a match, we will pass the right signing key to `express-jwt`.
3. `express-jwt` will the continue its own logic to validate the signature of the token, the expiration, `audience` and the `issuer`.

The steps we will follow in our code are:

* Create the middleware function to validate the <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Access+Token">Access Token</Tooltip>.
* Enable the use of the middleware in our routes.

You can also write some code to actually save the timesheet to a database. This is our sample implementation (some code is omitted for brevity):

```javascript lines expandable
// set dependencies - code omitted

// Enable CORS - code omitted

// Create middleware for checking the JWT
const checkJwt = jwt({
  // Dynamically provide a signing key based on the kid in the header and the signing keys provided by the JWKS endpoint
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `https://{yourDomain}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  }),

  // Validate the audience and the issuer
  audience: '{YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER}', //replace with your API's audience, available at Dashboard > APIs
  issuer: 'https://{yourDomain}/',
  algorithms: [ 'RS256' ]
});

// Enable the use of request body parsing middleware - code omitted

// create timesheets API endpoint - code omitted
app.post('/timesheets', checkJwt, function(req, res){
  var timesheet = req.body;

  // Save the timesheet to the database...

  //send the response
  res.status(201).send(timesheet);
});
// launch the API Server at localhost:8080 - code omitted
```






If we launch our server now and do an HTTP POST to `localhost:8080/timesheets` we should get the error message `Missing or invalid token` (which is perfectly fine since we didn’t send an Access Token in our request).

In order to test the working scenario as well we need to:

* Get an Access Token. For details on how to do so refer to: [Get an Access Token](/docs/get-started/architecture-scenarios/server-application-api#get-an-access-token).
* Invoke the API while adding an `Authorization` header to our request with the value `Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN` (where `ACCESS_TOKEN` is the value of the token we retrieved in the first step).

## Step 3. Check the application permissions

In this step we will add to our implementation the ability to check if the application has permissions (or `scope`) to use our endpoint in order to create a timesheet. In particular we want to ensure that the token has the correct scope, which is `batch:upload`.

In order to do this we will make use of the `express-jwt-authz` Node.js package, so go ahead and add that to your project:

```bash lines
npm install express-jwt-authz --save
```






Now it is as simple as adding a call to `jwtAuthz(...)` to your middleware to ensure that the JWT contain a particular scope in order to execute a particular endpoint.

We will add an additional dependency. The **express-jwt-authz** library, which is used in conjunction with express-jwt, validates the [JWT](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) and ensures it bears the correct permissions to call the desired endpoint. For more information refer to the [express-jwt-authz GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt-authz).

This is our sample implementation (some code is omitted for brevity):

```javascript lines
// set dependencies - some code omitted
const jwtAuthz = require('express-jwt-authz');

// Enable CORS - code omitted

// Create middleware for checking the JWT - code omitted

// Enable the use of request body parsing middleware - code omitted

// create timesheets API endpoint
app.post('/timesheets', checkJwt, jwtAuthz(['create:timesheets'], { customUserKey: 'auth' }), function(req, res){
  var timesheet = req.body;

  // Save the timesheet to the database...

  //send the response
  res.status(201).send(timesheet);
})

// launch the API Server at localhost:8080 - code omitted
```






If we invoke our API with a token that does not include this scope we should get the error message Forbidden with the HTTP status code `403`. You can test this by removing this scope from your API.

## Step 4. Determine the User Identity

The `express-jwt` middleware which is used to validate the JWT, also sets the `req.auth` with the information contained in the JWT. If you want to use the `sub` claim to identify the user uniquely, you can simply use `req.auth.sub`.

In the case of the timesheets application however, we want to use the email address of the user as the unique identifier.

The first thing we need to do is to write a rule which will add the email address of the user to the Access Token. Go to the [Rules section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules%7D) of the Dashboard and click on the **Create Rule** button.

You can give the rule a descriptive name, for example `Add email to Access Token`, and then use the following code for the rule:

```javascript lines
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = 'https://api.exampleco.com/';
  context.accessToken[namespace + 'email'] = user.email;
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```






The `namespace` is used to ensure the claim has a unique name and does not clash with the names of any of the standard OIDC claims. However, Auth0 supports namespaced and non-namespaced custom claims. For more info on custom claims, see [Create Custom Claims](/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/create-custom-claims).

Next, inside your API, you can retrieve the value of the claim from `req.auth`, and use that as the unique user identity which you can associate with timesheet entries.

```js lines
app.get('/timesheets', checkJwt, jwtAuthz(['read:timesheets'], { customUserKey: 'auth' }), function(req, res) {
  var timesheet = req.body;

  // Associate the timesheet entry with the current user
  var userId = req.auth['https://api.exampleco.com/email'];
  timesheet.user_id = userId;

  // Save the timesheet to the database...

  //send the response
  res.status(201).send(timesheet);
});
```
