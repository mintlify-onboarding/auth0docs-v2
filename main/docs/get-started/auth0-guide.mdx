Guide is currently in Early Access and is being rolled out to users in the US Public Cloud region. As Guide may occasionally provide incomplete or inaccurate responses, always [review and validate](#how-does-guide-avoid-ai-hallucinations%3F) them using the provided links. To learn more about Auth0 releases, read [Product Release Stages](/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/product-release-stages).

</Callout>

Guide is an AI-powered chatbot that answers your questions about Auth0. It sources information from our [Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs), [Blog](https://auth0.com/blog), and [Community](http://community.auth0.com). For Enterprise subscription customers, Guide also leverages Auth0 tenant data from [Security Center](/secure/security-center) to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and implement tenant security best practices.

Guide answers your questions, such as "How do I set up passkeys?" with a summarized answer and links to relevant documentation and [incident playbooks](/secure/attack-protection/playbooks) for tenant and user security.

## How Guide works

Guide processes your message to determine what you’re asking for, searches Auth0 sources for relevant information, then generates a summarized response based on what it found along with links to the referenced materials.

You can ask follow-up questions, [validate its responses](#how-does-guide-avoid-ai-hallucinations%3F) using the provided links, and give feedback on Guide by rating its responses.

For Enterprise subscription customers: If you [configure security monitoring alerts](/secure/security-center/security-alerts) in Security Center, Guide helps you troubleshoot incidents and suggests security guidance from a relevant [incident playbook](/secure/attack-protection/playbooks).

For example, as shown in the following screenshot, when a significant bot surge triggers your <Tooltip tip="Bot Detection: Form of attack protection in which Auth0 blocks suspected bot traffic by enabling a CAPTCHA during the login process." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Bot+Detection">Bot Detection</Tooltip> alert, Guide recommends remediation steps from the [Bot Detection Attack playbook](/secure/attack-protection/playbooks/bot-detection-playbook), such as activating CAPTCHA for affected authentication flows, and prompts you to inspect relevant events in the tenant logs.
