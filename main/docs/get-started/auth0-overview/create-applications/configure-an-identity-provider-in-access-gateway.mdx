To integrate Auth0 with a machine-to-machine (M2M) application, you must first register your app with Auth0 using the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>.

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and click **Create Application**.
2. Enter a descriptive name for your application, select **Machine to Machine Applications**, and click **Create**.
3. Select the Management API to authorize M2M communication, as this is how OAG interacts with Auth0.

4. Click **Authorize**.

5. Each M2M app that accesses an API must be granted a set of permissions (or scopes) that should be granted by the authenticated user. Select the **Permissions** that you want to be issued as part of your application's <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip>. OAG requires the following permissions for the **client** and **users:**

* `read:client, write:client, update:client, delete:client`
* `read:users`

6. Click **Authorize**.

7. Select the **Credentials** tab of your application.

8. Click the **<Tooltip tip="Client ID: Identification value given to your registered resource from Auth0." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+ID">Client ID</Tooltip>** and copy it into a text editor app.

9. Click the **<Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+Secret">Client Secret</Tooltip>** and copy it into a text editor app.

10. Continue with the [Configure an Identity Provider in Access Gateway](/docs/Configure an Identity Provider in Access Gateway) procedure.
