To integrate Auth0 with a regular web app, you must first register your app with Auth0 using the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. These apps may include traditional web apps that perform most of their application logic on the server (for example, Express.js, ASP.NET).

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and click **Create Application**.
2. Enter a descriptive name for your application, select **Regular Web Applications**, and click **Create**.

   Once the new application is created, you will be directed to **Application** **Settings** which includes the following tabs:

   <table class="table"><thead>
   <tr>
   <th><strong>Settings Tab</strong></th>
   <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Quick Start</strong></td>
   <td>Shows all the available documentation for your application type.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Settings</strong></td>
   <td>Shows all available settings for your application. By default, most of the settings will be created for you. To learn more, read <a href="/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings">Application Settings</a>.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Credentials</strong></td>
   <td>Shows the application’s authentication method and configured credentials. To learn more, read <a href="/docs/secure/application-credentials">Application Credentials</a></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Add-ons</strong></td>
   <td>Allows you to enable plugins associated with an application. These are SAML or WS-Fed web apps for which Auth0 generates access tokens. To learn more, read <a href="/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/enable-saml2-web-app-addon">Enable SAML2 Web App Addon</a> and <a href="/docs/get-started/applications/update-application-connections">Configure WS-Fed Applications</a>.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Connections</strong></td>
   <td>Allows you to enable connections for your application. Connections are sources of users; they can be enabled and shared between multiple applications. To learn more, read <a href="/docs/authenticate/identity-providers">Connections</a>.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Organizations</strong></td>
   <td>Allows you to authenticate users into organizations to which they belong. To learn more, read <a href="/docs/manage-users/organizations">Organizations</a>.</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

   To learn more, read [Application Settings](/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings).
3. Scroll down and locate the **Trust Token Endpoint IP Header** setting, enable it, and click **Save Changes**. When enabled, this protects against brute-force attacks.

## Next steps

Once you have registered and configured your application, some common next steps are:

* Configure a connection and enable it for your application.
* Modify your app code to use your Auth0-registered application. See our [Auth0 Quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts), where you'll find detailed instructions and samples for a variety of technologies. You'll also learn how to implement login and logout, handle your user sessions, retrieve and display user profile information, and more.
* Use [Auth0 APIs](/docs/api).

  + The [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication) handles all primary identity-related functions (for example, login, logout, and get user profile). Most users consume this API through our Quickstarts, the [Auth0.js library](/docs/libraries/auth0js), or the [Lock widget](/docs/libraries/lock). However, if you are building all of your authentication UI manually, you will have to interact with this API directly.
  + The [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) allows you to automate various tasks that can also be accessed via the Dashboard in Auth0 (for example: creating users, setting application grant types).
