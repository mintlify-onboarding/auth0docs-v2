Auth0 offers the ability for customers with an Enterprise subscription to link multiple tenants under a single Auth0 subscription (these linked tenants can also be referred to as child tenants).

This feature can be useful under the following situations:

* Separate development and production tenants while keeping the same feature access on development tenants as available in production tenants
* Own more than one production tenant under a single Enterprise subscription

## Linking tenants

Enterprise subscription automatically allows for users to link tenants under an existing Auth0 subscription by selection "Custom Agreement" option from Create Under when creating new tenants.

If you need to link previously created tenants that are not currently part of your Enterprise subscription, contact your designated Technical Account Manager.

You can also link accounts if you have a self-service tenant. To learn more, read [Tenant Management](/docs/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-management).

## Usage Consolidation

Usage from linked tenants count toward the Enterprise subscription limits and are aggregated under applicable usage and quota reports.
