The Activity page provides a summary of key data about your Auth0 tenant, including information on active users, failed logins, and more.

## Things to know

* Viewing a tenant's Activity page requires an account with an administrator role.
* The **Support Access** role has limited access to the tenant's Activity page.
* To ensure data is consistent, the current date cannot be selected in the date picker and data may take up to 12-24 hours to display.

## Metrics

Here’s what you will see on your tenant's Activity page.

### Totals

At the top of the page, you'll see your tenant's total number of users, applications, APIs, and connections.
