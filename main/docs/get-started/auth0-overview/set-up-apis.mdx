Before you register any APIs in the Auth0 Dashboard, one API will already exist: the **Auth0 Management API**. To learn more about the features of the Management API and its available endpoints, see [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

</Callout>

1. Go to [Dashboard > Applications > APIs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis), and select **+ Create API**.
2. Provide the following information for your API, and click **Create**:

   <table class="table"><thead>
   <tr>
   <th><strong>Field</strong></th>
   <th><strong>Description</strong></th>
   <th><strong>Example</strong></th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Name</strong></td>
   <td>A friendly name for the API. Does not affect any functionality.</td>
   <td><code>yourDomain</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>Identifier</strong></td>
   <td>A unique identifier for the API. Auth0 recommends using a URL. Auth0 does differentiate between URLs that include the last forward slash. For example, `https://example.com` and `https://example.com/` are two different identifiers. The URL does not have to be a publicly available URL. Auth0 will not call your API. This value cannot be modified afterwards.</td>
   <td>`https://{yourDomain}`</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile</strong></td>
   <td>The profile determines the format of the access tokens issued for the API. The available values are <code>Auth0</code> and <code>RFC 9068</code>. To learn more, read <a href="/secure/tokens/access-tokens/access-token-profiles">Access Token Profiles</a>.</td>
   <td><code>access_token</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><strong>JSON Web Token (JWT) Signing Algorithm</strong></td>
   <td>The algorithm to sign the access tokens with. The available values are <code>HS256</code>, <code>PS256</code>, <code>RS256</code>. If you select <code>RS256</code>, the token will be signed with the tenant's private key.</td>
   <td><code>HS256</code></td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>
3. Make the implementation changes to your API that are described in the QuickStart. These changes consist of choosing a JWT library from a predefined list and configuring this library to validate the access tokens in your API.

   <Warning>

   If you are creating a new custom API and also have Single-Page or Native applications in your tenant, you must enable Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to keep users logged in to these applications from generating an access token for your API that does not consider scopes. To learn how to enable RBAC for your API, read [Enable Role-Based Access Control for APIs](/get-started/apis/enable-role-based-access-control-for-apis).

   </Warning>

The other available Dashboard views for your API are:

* **Settings**: Lists the settings for your API. Some are editable. Here you can change the token expiration time and enable offline access (this way Auth0 will allow your applications to ask for <Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=refresh+tokens">refresh tokens</Tooltip> for this API).
* **Scopes**: Define the scopes for this API by setting a name and a description.
* **Machine to Machine Applications**: Lists all applications for which the **Client Credentials** grant is enabled. By default, this grant is enabled for regular web applications and machine-to-machine applications. You can authorize any of these applications to request <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=access+tokens">access tokens</Tooltip> for your API. Optionally, you can select a subset of the defined scopes to limit your authorized application's access.
* **Test**: Execute a sample client credentials flow with any of your authorized applications to check that everything is working as expected.
