## mTLS in OAuth/OIDC

Default <Tooltip tip="OAuth 2.0: Authorization framework that defines authorization protocols and workflows." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=OAuth">OAuth</Tooltip>/OIDC flows are not always secure because of the following issues:

* The use of a shared <Tooltip tip="Client Secret: Secret used by a client (application) to authenticate with the Authorization Server; it should be known to only the client and the Authorization Server and must be sufficiently random to not be guessable." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Client+Secret">Client Secret</Tooltip> as a form of client authentication.
* The ability for an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip> to be used by unintended parties.

In 2020, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) released [RFC 8705](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705) Mutual-TLS (mTLS) client authentication to address these issues. With mTLS authentication, the client certificate with a private key functions like a Client Secret in an OAuth/OIDC flow to verify the client’s identity. If a client is already authenticated at the network layer, there’s no need for a Client Secret at the application layer. Additionally, client certificates can be used with multiple servers to prove a client’s identity to a <Tooltip tip="Resource Server: Server hosting protected resources. Resource servers accept and respond to protected resource requests." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=resource+server">resource server</Tooltip>. Note there are other approaches to solve the above issues, namely [Private Key JWT](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authenticate-with-private-key-jwt) and [DPoP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449) respectively.

To secure an OAuth flow with mTLS, clients send a mTLS certificate to the TLS termination point on the customer edge network when the TLS connection is being established. Before the <Tooltip tip="Authorization Server: Centralized server that contributes to defining the boundaries of a user’s access. For example, your authorization server can control the data, tasks, and features available to a user." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=authorization+server">authorization server</Tooltip> processes the request, it must first verify the client’s mTLS certificate.

Optionally, mTLS can also be used to ensure an access token is used only by the intended party, known as Sender Constraining or Token Binding. When the client calls the `/oauth/token` endpoint on the authorization server using an mTLS connection, the resulting access token contains information that the resource server uses to verify that the client’s TLS certificate matches that of the access token.

**Note**: mTLS client authentication and mTLS Token Binding can be used independently of each other. mTLS client authentication can be used without mTLS Token Binding, and mTLS Token Binding can be used with other forms of client authentication such as Client Secret or Private Key <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip>. Even if other forms of client authentication are used, the client still sends the client certificate to the authorization server for mTLS Token Binding.

## mTLS at Auth0

mTLS for Auth0 builds on [custom domains](/docs/customize/custom-domains) and leverages the customer’s existing mTLS infrastructure to perform certificate provisioning and verification.

Authenticated client calls to Auth0 that normally require a Client Secret are first sent to the customer edge. This already happens for <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=custom+domains">custom domains</Tooltip> that use customer-managed certificates. The customer edge performs the mTLS handshake with the client and validates the client certificate. Once the client certificate is verified, the request is then forwarded to the tenant’s edge domain at Auth0, including the validated client certificate in an HTTP header along with the correct `cname-api-key` as per the custom domains functionality.

## Call the authorization server

Since mTLS serves both client authentication and access token binding, the client must know whether these features are enabled on the authorization server. In addition, an authorization server’s mTLS endpoints and non-mTLS endpoints may be exposed on different domains.

To get configuration details about the authorization server, the client sends a GET request to the [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) endpoint: `https://<custom-domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration`

A successful response returns the OIDC discovery document, or a JSON object listing the authorization server’s properties and endpoints, including those related to mTLS.

If mTLS client authentication is enabled, the OIDC discovery document includes the `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` property, which contains either `tls_client_auth` or `self_signed_tls_client_auth`:

```json lines
{
  ...
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["tls_client_auth"]
  ...
}
```






If mTLS Token Binding is enabled, the OIDC discovery document sets the  `tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens` property to `true:`

```json lines
{
  ...
  "tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens": true
  ...
}
```






Environments that support mTLS endpoint aliases expose a new property, `mtls_endpoint_aliases`, that contains a list of endpoints that support mTLS. For clients that support mTLS, the endpoints listed under `mtls_endpoint_aliases` take precedence over the same endpoints exposed outside of `mtls_endpoint_aliases`.

In the following code sample, the `token_endpoint` property is exposed twice. The endpoint to use for mTLS calls is listed under `mtls_endpoint_aliases`, or `https://mtls.auth.bank.com/oauth/token`:

```json lines
{
  ...
  "mtls_endpoint_aliases": {
"token_endpoint": "https://mtls.auth.bank.com/oauth/token"
  },
  "token_endpoint": "https://auth.bank.com/oauth/token",
  "pushed_authorization_request_endpoint": "https://auth.bank.com/oauth/par",
  ...
}
```






If an endpoint is not listed under `mtls_endpoint_aliases`, use the same endpoint listed outside of `mtls_endpoint_aliases`. In the example above, `pushed_authorization_request_endpoint` is not listed under `mtls_endpoint_aliases`. As a result, use the `pushed_authorization_request_endpoint` exposed outside of `mtls_endpoint_aliases`, or `https://auth.bank.com/oauth/par`.

For more information, see RFC 8705’s [section on endpoint aliases](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705#name-metadata-for-mutual-tls-end).

## Call the resource server

Once a client receives an access token, it can access protected resources on a resource server. If mTLS Token Binding is enabled, the authorization server returns the OIDC discovery document that contains the `tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens` property.

When the client calls the resource server with a mTLS-bound access token, the resource server requests a mTLS certificate from the client during the TLS handshake. The resource server should reject requests with an access token that does not match that client certificate with a 401 HTTP status code and an `invalid_token` error code.
