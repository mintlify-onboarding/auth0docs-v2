If you are a tenant administrator, you can change a user's assigned role(s). The changes take effect after users refresh their Dashboard.

You can assign a user more than one role and the permissions will be combined. You must have already added the tenant member.

1. Go to [Dashboard > Settings > Tenant Members](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/admins).
2. Click **...** to the right of a user name or email and click **Edit Roles**.
   If you don't see that option, it means that the user has not yet accepted their invitation.
3. Select additional roles or remove roles.
4. Click **Save**.

The user's permissions will be visible when they refresh their Dashboard. If the user does not refresh, they may encounter errors indicating that they do not have access to a specific area. If one of those errors occurs, the user will have to log out and log in again.
