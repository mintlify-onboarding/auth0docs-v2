To authorize Machine-to-Machine access for an application, you must enable it to use an organization for a specific API. To do so, you must associate the application's client grant to the corresponding API with the organization. Once associated, the application can use the organization when requesting tokens for the API and scopes defined in the client grant. You will need to define this association for each API your application needs to access for the organization.

You can authorize M2M access for an application using the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) or [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

Application client grants can be associated with an organization via the [Associate client grant to organization](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/organizations/create-organization-client-grants) endpoint:

```bash lines
curl -X POST --location "https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/api/v2/organizations/{ORG_id}/client-grants" \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
          "grant_id": "GRANT_ID"
        }'
```
