## Business cases

The Auth0 Organizations feature best supports business-to-business (B2B) implementations that have applications that end-users access.

<Frame>![B2B Organizations Business Case diagram](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/4l47Xknr2LpuMSOX0T3yCP/800877a39f474faa0c6d83551d56c337/b2b-business-case.png)</Frame>

Common features of B2B implementations include:

* A product that is licensed to another business for use by their employees.
* Each organization requires its own federation and lightweight branding of the authentication experience.
* Access levels in the application can be represented by roles that are assigned to members of each organization.

Let’s explore some example business cases to highlight the ways in which Organizations can help.

## Sample scenario

Travel0 is a fictitious company that offers online travel services and has set up an Auth0 tenant. Travel0 has several applications, but we’ll focus on one application that could benefit from using Organizations.

**Travel0 Adventure Management**: An online application that allows its customers to create and market adventures, such as whitewater rafting, horseback riding, and zip lining. Each adventure is led by a guide who can use the application to sign up and manage scheduling. Guides may be either employed by the customer directly or freelance.

Customers of the application include:

* **Granite Outpost Rafting and Ziplines**: An established company that directly employs their large staff of guides, but sometimes also reaches out to freelance guides. They have their own <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=IdP">IdP</Tooltip> that they use for their employees.
* **AdventureZ**: A large event company that directly employs a large number of guides, but also uses freelancers, though rarely. They also facilitate their direct employees’ ability to freelance for other companies who are in need of guides. They have their own IdP that they use for their employees.
* **Rocky Mountain High Adventures**: A new company just coming to market. The co-founders run most of their tours, and they reach out to freelancers for help during busy times. They don’t have an IT staff, and have neither the time nor inclination to set up their own identity provider (IdP). They have a contract with AdventureZ that allows any AdventureZ employees to freelance for them.

## Planning considerations

When setting up organizations, consider the following:

* **Login experience**: Will users be required to select an organization when logging in? Will users see the application’s default login page or a customized login page for their organization?
* **Connection model**: Will any users be shared between organizations? Do users need to be able to log in using an organization’s own internal identity provider?
* **Roles**: Does the application need users to have specific roles assigned within their organizations? Do you intend to build a custom dashboard that allows administrators to self-manage their organizations using assigned roles?

### Login experience

First, you must decide what the user should experience when they log in to an organization. You can choose to send the end-user directly to a specific Organization’s login prompt in Auth0, or you can send them to a prompt in which they can enter the name of the Organization with which they want to log in.

Additionally, you must choose whether to use the default <Tooltip tip="Universal Login: Your application redirects to Universal Login, hosted on Auth0's Authorization Server, to verify a user's identity." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Universal+Login">Universal Login</Tooltip> page that is configured for your application or to customize a login page specific to each organization using page templates. To learn more, see [Create Your First Organization](/docs/manage-users/organizations/create-first-organization).

### Connection model

Each organization will usually map directly to one of your business customers or partners, but users can be members of multiple organizations. Understanding how users map to customer organizations will help you determine how to model your organizations and connections. There are two user scenarios:

* **Users are isolated to an organization**: Every user is a member of exactly one organization. Either users will never need to be part of multiple organizations, or it would make more sense for users to create a separate identity for each organization.
* **Users are shared between organizations**: Any user may belong to multiple organizations and should be able to use the same identity to navigate between organizations.

Using our Travel0 Adventure Management example, let’s assume the following users:

* **Jonno**: A guide who is directly employed by Rocky Mountain High Adventures and who should be able to log in to only Rocky Mountain’s organization.
  Because Rocky Mountain does not have its own IdP, Jonno’s credentials are stored in the Travel0 database connection and Jonno is assigned membership to the Rocky Mountain organization.
* **Hiroko**: A guide who is directly employed by Granite Outpost Rafting and Ziplines and who should be able to log in to only Granite Outpost’s organization.
  Because Granite Outpost has its own IdP, Hiroko’s credentials may be stored in either the Travel0 database connection or an enterprise connection that Granite Outpost has set up to represent their IdP, and then Hiroko must also be assigned membership in Granite Outpost’s organization. If using Granite Outpost’s IdP, then the enterprise connection must also be enabled for the organization.
* **Emilio**: A guide who freelances for both Rocky Mountain High Adventures and Granite Outpost Rafting and Ziplines and should be able to log in to both organizations.
  If we want Emilio to be able to use the same credentials for both organizations, then Emilio’s credentials should be stored in the Travel0 database connection, and Emilio should be assigned membership in both Rocky Mountain and Granite Outpost organizations.
  Otherwise, Emilio will need to set up one set of credentials in the Travel0 database connection for Rocky Mountain High Adventures and be assigned membership in the Rocky Mountain High organization, then set up another set of credentials in either the Travel0 database connection or Granite Outpost’s enterprise connection and be assigned membership in the Granite Outpost organization. Finally, if using Granite Outpost’s IdP, the configured enterprise connection must be enabled for the Granite Outpost organization.
* **Sumana**: A guide who is directly employed by AdventureZ, but sometimes freelances for Rocky Mountain High Adventures under the contract Rocky Mountain has with AdventureZ. AdventureZ and Rocky Mountain have rating systems for their guides, and Sumana’s ratings need to carry over from AdventureZ to Rocky Mountain and be combined between organizations.
  Either Sumana’s credentials should be stored in the Travel0 database connection and membership should be assigned for both the Rocky Mountain and AdventureZ organizations, or if AdventureZ wants to share their IdP, then Sumana’s credentials should be stored in an enterprise connection that AdventureZ has set up to represent their IdP and the configured enterprise connection must be enabled for both the Rocky Mountain and AdventureZ organizations.
  If Sumana is also invited to freelance for Granite Outpost Rafting and Ziplines, then her credentials could be stored in the Travel0 database connection or she could be added to Granite Outpost’s IdP, and membership should be assigned to the Granite Outpost organization.

Once you have determined how many organizations you will have and what your connection model should look like, you can set up [database](/docs/authenticate/database-connections), [social](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers), or [enterprise](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers) connections; [create organizations](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/create-organizations); and [configure organization membership](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/invite-members) or [enable organization connections](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/enable-connections).

### Roles

Members of organizations can be [assigned roles](/docs/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/add-member-roles). You can use these roles to define access control for your application. For example, if you built a dashboard for your users using our API and SDKs, you could assign an administrator role to certain members and allow them to self-manage their organizations through your dashboard.

<Warning>

The Management API should be accessed using only a confidential client. Its use is subject to [Auth0 Management API rate limits](/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy/management-api-endpoint-rate-limits).

</Warning>

## Limitations

The Auth0 Organizations feature has the following limitations:

* Your Auth0 subscription plan affects the availability of this feature. To learn more, read [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/).
* Supported only for Universal Login (not supported for Classic Login or Lock.js).
* Organizations-enabled applications are not compatible with the following grants and protocols: <Tooltip tip="Web Service Federation (WS-Fed): Protocol for managing user identities across domains." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Resource+Owner">Resource Owner</Tooltip> Password, Device <Tooltip tip="Resource Owner: Entity (such as a user or application) capable of granting access to a protected resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Authorization+Flow">Authorization Flow</Tooltip>, <Tooltip tip="Authorization Flow: Authorization grant (or workflow) specified in the OAuth 2.0 framework." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=WS-Fed">WS-Fed</Tooltip> (Auth0 as IdP).
* Does not support:

  + Custom domains per organization (For example, using the sample scenario, if Rocky Mountain High Adventures and Granite Outpost Rafting and Ziplining could both use `login.travel0.com` as login domains, then Organizations would be useful. Alternatively, if Rocky Mountain High Adventures wanted to use `login.rockymountain.com` and Granite Outpost wanted to use `login.graniteoutpost.com`, then you would need to use multiple Auth0 tenants.
  + Integration with the Delegated Administration Extension.
  + Integration with the Authorization Extension.
  + Integration with third-party applications.
