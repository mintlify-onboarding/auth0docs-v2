By default, user profile attributes provided by <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=identity+providers">identity providers</Tooltip> other than Auth0 (such as Google, Facebook, or X) are not directly editable because they are updated from the identity provider each time the user logs in. Fore more information on attributes from identity providers, read [Configure Identity Provider Connection for User Profile Updates](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0).

These root attributes will then be available to be edited individually or by bulk imports
