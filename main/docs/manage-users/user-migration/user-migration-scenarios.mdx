Here are some sample scenarios for migrating users from Gigya, Okta, and Stormpath to Auth0. Each of these scenarios assumes that you have accounts on those platforms.

## Prerequisites

Configure the [custom database connection](/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db).

1. Create a new database connection at [Dashboard > Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database). Be sure to select the **Custom Database** view, and enable the **Use my own database** switch.
2. Connect the database to the application: In your database connection settings, select the **Applications** view. Locate the **Applications Using This Connection** section, and enable the database connection for each application.

## Scenario 1: Migrate Users from Gigya to Auth0

1. Export Gigya users: 
Use [Gigya's IdentitySync](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CUSTOMER_DATA_CLOUD/8b8d6fffe113457094a17701f63e3d6a/2b717202e42a4165aa7f75f7eecab64f.html) to transform and export user data to match a target schema. To learn more about this process, see [Gigya IdentitySync: Using IdentitySync](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CUSTOMER_DATA_CLOUD/8b8d6fffe113457094a17701f63e3d6a/2b717202e42a4165aa7f75f7eecab64f.html?locale=en-US).<br /><br />

   Follow the instructions to transform your Gigya database's user data to the correct [schema](/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-import-database-schema-and-examples) and export the transformed data to JSON format.
2. Import your Gigya users into Auth0: 
You can import users with either the [User Import/Export Extension](/manage-users/user-migration/user-import-export-extension) or the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

   * **User Import/Export Extension**: Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), select the **User Import / Export** extension, and install it. Once the extension is installed, you can click it to open an import/export interface.<br /><br />
      
     Drag your exported Gigya users JSON file into the designated upload area, and select the database you created earlier. Select **Start Importing Users** to begin your import. To learn more, see [User Import/Export Extension](/manage-users/user-migration/user-import-export-extension).
   * **Management API**: [Create a job](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_users_imports) to import your users to Auth0. For detailed instructions, read [Bulk User Imports](/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-imports).

## Scenario 2: Migrate Users from Okta to Auth0

1. Enable importing users: Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database) and select your database connection. In its **Settings**, enable the **Import Users to Auth0** option.
2. Create the [Login script](/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/templates/login): The **Login** script is executed when a user attempts to log in, but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You must create a script that will call the Okta [Primary Authentication](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#primary-authentication) endpoint, passing the email and password as the `username` and `password` parameters.
   On successful authentication, Okta will return an [Authentication Transaction object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#authentication-transaction-model), containing the [user's profile](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#user-profile-object) in the [embedded resources](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#embedded-resources). You can then extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.<br /><br />

   In your database connection's **Custom Database** view, locate **Database Action Scripts**, and select **Login**.

   ```javascript lines expandable
   function login (email, password, callback) {
     // Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your own Okta domain
     var url = 'https:/{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/authn';

     // Make the POST request to authenticate a user
     request({
       url: url,
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         'Accept': 'application/json'
       },
       body: {
         username: email,
         password: password,
         options: {
           multiOptionalFactorEnroll: false,
           warnBeforePasswordExpired: false
         }
       },
       json: true
     }, function (error, response, body) {
       // Ensure we have a successful response
       if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

       // Get the user from the response body
       var user = body._embedded.user;

       // Set the data we want to store in Auth0 and migrate the user
       return callback(null, {
           user_id : user.id,
           username: user.profile.login,
           email: user.profile.login,
           // We set the users email_verified to true as we assume if they were a valid
           // user in Okta, they have already verified their email
           // If this field is not set, the user will get an email asking them to verify
           // their account
           email_verified: true,
           name: user.profile.firstName + ' ' + user.profile.lastName
         });
     });
   }
   ```


   

   

   Click the **Try** button above the script to test whether the script works.
3. Create the [Get User script](/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/templates/get-user): The **Get User** script is executed when the user attempts to reset their password but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script that calls the Okta [Get User with Login](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/users.html#get-user-with-login) endpoint, passing the user's email as the `login` parameter.
   You will also need to [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html) which must be passed to this endpoint in the `Authorization` header.
   If successful, Okta will return a [User object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/users.html#user-model) with the user's information. Once again, you can extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.<br /><br />

   In your database connection's **Custom Database** view, locate **Database Action Scripts**, and select **Get User**.

   ```javascript lines expandable
   function getByEmail(email, callback) {
     // Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your own Okta domain
     var url = 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/' + encodeURIComponent(email);

     // Make a GET request to find a user by email
     // Replace {yourOktaApiToken} with an Okta API Token 
     // (see https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html) 
     request({
       url: url,
       method: 'GET',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         'Accept': 'application/json',
         'Authorization': 'SSWS ' + '{yourOktaApiToken}'
       },
       json: true
     }, function (error, response, body) {
       // Ensure we have a successful response
       if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

       // Set the data we want to store in Auth0 and migrate the user
       return callback(null, {
         user_id: body.id,
         username: body.profile.login,
         email: body.profile.login,
         email_verified: true,
         name: body.profile.firstName + ' ' + body.profile.lastName
       });
     });
   }
   ```


   

   

   Click the **Try** button above the script to test whether the script works.
4. Test the custom database connection: Click **Try connection**. The [Auth0 Lock widget](/libraries/lock) will appear. Enter the email address and password for the Okta user, and click **Log In.** You should see a web page indicating that the connection works, with information about the user.
5. To see the newly imported users, go to [Auth0 Dashboard > User Management > Users](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users).

## Scenario 3: Migrate users from Stormpath to Auth0

1. Enable importing users: Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Database](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/database) and select your database connection. In its **Settings**, enable the **Import Users to Auth0** option.
2. Enable applications for your connection: Select the **Applications** view. Enable the applications that will use the database connection.
3. Create the [Login script](/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/templates/login): The **Login** script is executed when a user attempts to log in, but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script that calls Stormpath's API to authenticate the user, passing the user credentials as the `username` and `password` parameters.<br /><br />

   On successful authentication, the response from Stormpath will include the user account URL. Perform a second request to the account URL to retrieve the user's information. You can then extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.

   ```javascript lines expandable
   function login(username, password, callback) {
     // Replace the {yourStormpathClientId} attribute with your Stormpath ID
     var url = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/{yourStormpathClientId}/loginAttempts';

     // Stormpath requires the user credentials be passed in as a base64 encoded message
     var message = username + ':' + password;
     var pass = new Buffer(message).toString('base64');

     // Here we are making the POST request to authenticate a user
     request({
       url: url,
       method: 'POST',
       auth: {
         // Your API Client ID
         user: '{yourStormpathClientId}',
         // Your API Client Secret
         password: '{yourStormpathClientSecret}'
       },
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
       },
       json: {
         type: 'basic',
         // Passing in the base64 encoded credentials
         value: pass
       }
     }, function (error, response, body) {
       // If response is successful we'll continue
       if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();
       // A successful response will return a URL to get the user information
       var accountUrl = body.account.href;

       // We'll make a second request to get the user info. This time it will be a GET request
       request({
         url: accountUrl,
         method: 'GET',
         auth: {
           // Your API Client ID
           user: '{yourStormpathClientId}',
           // YOUR API Client Secret
           password: '{yourStormpathClientSecret}'
         }
       }, function (errorUserInfo, responseUserInfo, bodyUserInfo) {
         // If we get a successful response, we'll process it
         if (responseUserInfo.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

         var parsedBody = JSON.parse(bodyUserInfo);
         // To get the user identifier, we'll strip out the Stormpath API
         var id = parsedBody.href.replace('https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/', '');

         // Finally, we'll set the data we want to store in Auth0 and migrate the user
         return callback(null, {
           user_id : id,
           username: parsedBody.username,
           email: parsedBody.email,
           // We set the users email_verified to true as we assume if they were a valid
           // user in Stormpath, they have already verified their email
           // If this field is not set, the user will get an email asking them to verify
           // their account
           email_verified: true,
           // Add any additional fields you would like to carry over from Stormpath
         });
       });
     });
   }
   ```


   

   

   Click the **Try** button above the script to test and see whether the script works.
4. Create the [Get User script](/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/templates/get-user): The **Get User** script is executed when the user attempts to do a password reset but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script that will call the `/accounts` endpoint of the Stormpath API, passing the user's email as the `email` parameter.
   If successful, Stormpath will return the user's information. You can extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.

   ```javascript lines expandable
   function getByEmail(email, callback) {
     // Replace the {yourStormpathClientId} attribute with your Stormpath ID
     var url = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/{yourStormpathClientId}/accounts';

     request({
       url: url,
       method: 'GET',
       auth: {
         // Your API Client ID
         user: '{yourStormpathClientId}',
         // YOUR API Client Secret
         password: '{yourStormpathClientSecret}'
       },
       qs: { q: email }
     }, function (error, response, body) {
       if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

       var parsedBody = JSON.parse(body);
       var user = parsedBody.items[0];

       if (!user) return callback();

       var id = user.href.replace('https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/', '');

       return callback(null, {
         user_id: id,
         username: user.username,
         email: user.email,
         email_verified: true,
         // Add any additional fields you would like to carry over from Stormpath
       });
     });
   }
   ```


   

   

   Click the **Try** button above the script to test and see whether the script works.
5. Test the custom database connection: Click **Try connection**. The [Auth0 Lock widget](/libraries/lock) will appear. Enter the email address and password for the Stormpath user, and click **Log In.** You should see a web page indicating that the connection works, with information about the user.
6. To see the newly imported users, go to [Dashboard > User Management > Users](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users).
