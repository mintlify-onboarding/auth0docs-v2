    Auth0 allows you to quickly add authentication and gain access to user profile information in your application.
        This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with an Ionic (Vue) & Capacitor application using the [Auth0 Vue SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-vue).

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1" isSingleColumn>
      This quickstart assumes you already have an [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) application up and running with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/). If not, check out the [Using
              Capacitor with Ionic Framework guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) to get started with a simple app, or clone [our sample
              apps](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ionic-samples).

      You should also be familiar with the [Capacitor development workflow](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/basics/workflow).

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2" isSingleColumn>
      To use Auth0 services, you need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure how you want authentication to work for your project.

      <Info>
      Throughout this article, `YOUR_PACKAGE_ID` is your application's package ID. This can be
                      found and configured in the `appId` field in your `capacitor.config.ts` file. See
                      [Capacitor's Config schema](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/config#schema) for more info.
      </Info>

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have
            authenticated. If not set, users will not be returned to your application after they log in

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `YOUR_PACKAGE_ID://{yourDomain}/capacitor/YOUR_PACKAGE_ID/callback`
      </Info>

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have logged
            out. If not set, users will not be able to log out from your application and will receive an error.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `YOUR_PACKAGE_ID://{yourDomain}/capacitor/YOUR_PACKAGE_ID/callback`.
      </Info>

      ### Configure Allowed Origins

      To be able to make requests from your native application to Auth0, set the following **Allowed Origins** in
            your <AuthLink href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings">Application Settings</AuthLink>.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `capacitor://localhost, http://localhost` for iOS and Android respectively.
      </Info>

      Lastly, be sure that the **Application Type** for your application is set to **Native** in the <AuthLink href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings">Application Settings</AuthLink>.

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3" isSingleColumn>
      Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 Vue SDK:

      ```bash
      npm install @auth0/auth0-vue
      ```

      The SDK exposes several types that help you integrate Auth0 with your Vue application idiomatically, including a
            module and an authentication service.

      ### Install Capacitor plugins

      This quickstart and sample make use of some of Capacitor's official plugins. Install these into your app using
            the following command:

      npm install @capacitor/browser @capacitor/app

      - [@capacitor/browser](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/browser) - allows you to interact with the device's
                system browser and is used to open the URL to Auth0's authorizaction endpoint
      - [@capacitor/app](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/app) - allows you to subscribe to high-level app
                events, useful for handling callbacks from Auth0

      <Info>
      Capacitor's Browser plugin on iOS uses [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller), which on iOS 11+ does not share
                      cookies with Safari on the device. This means that [SSO](https://auth0.com/docs/sso) will not work on those devices. If you need SSO, please instead use a
                      compatible plugin that uses [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession).
      </Info>
    
    <LoggedInForm />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4" isSingleColumn>
      The SDK exports `createAuth0`, a composable that contains all the services required for the SDK to
            function. This composable should be registered with your application and be configured with your Auth0 domain and
            Client ID.

      The `createAuth0` composable takes the following configuration:

      - `domain`: The `domain`value present under the **Settings **of the application you
                created in the Auth0 Dashboard, or your custom domain if you are using Auth0's [custom domains feature](http://localhost:3000/docs/custom-domains).
      - `clientId`: The Client ID value present under the **Settings **of the application you created
                in the Auth0 Dashboard.
      - `useRefreshTokens`: To use auth0-vue with Ionic on Android and iOS, it's required to enable
                refresh tokens.
      - `useRefreshTokensFallback`: To use auth0-vue with Ionic on Android and iOS, it's required to
                disable the iframe fallback.
      - `authorizationParams.redirect_uri`: The URL to redirect your users after they authenticate with
                Auth0.

      <Info>
      To persist authentication after closing and reopening the application, you may want to set
                      `cacheLocation` to `localstorage` when configuring the SDK, but please be aware of
                      [the risks of storing tokens in localstorage](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-single-page-app-sdk#change-storage-options). Also, localstorage should be treated
                      as **transient** in Capacitor app as the data might be recovered unexpectedly in certain
                      circumstances. Please read the [guidance on storage in the Capacitor docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/storage#why-cant-i-just-use-localstorage-or-indexeddb).

      Additionally, the SDK has the ability to [use a custom cache implementation](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md#creating-a-custom-cache) to store tokens, if
                      you have a requirement to use a more secure and persistent storage mechanism.

      **Note** that we recommend **against** using [Capacitor's Storage plugin](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/storage) to store tokens, as this is
                      backed by [UserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) and [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences) on iOS and Android respectively. Data stored using
                      these APIs is not encrypted, not secure, and could also be synced to the cloud.
      </Info>

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Now that you have configured your app with the Auth0 Vue SDK, run your application to verify that the SDK
                    is initializing without error, and that your application runs as it did before.
      </Note>

</Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5" isSingleColumn>
      In a Capacitor application, the [Capacitor's Browser plugin](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/browser) performs a redirect to the Auth0 [Universal Login Page](https://auth0.com/universal-login). Set the `openUrl`
            parameter on the `loginWithRedirect` function to use `Browser.open` so that the URL is
            opened using the device's system browser component ([SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) on iOS, and [Chrome
              Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs) on Android).

      <Info>
      By default, the SDK's `loginWithRedirect` method uses `window.location.href` to
                      navigate to the login page in the default browser application on the user's device rather than the
                      system browser component appropriate for the platform. The user would leave your application to
                      authenticate and could make for a suboptimal user experience.
      </Info>

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      The `loginWithRedirect` function tells the SDK to initiate the login flow, using the
                    `Browser.open` function to open the login URL with the platform's system browser component by
                    setting the `openUrl` parameter. This provides a way for your user to log in to your
                    application. Users redirect to the login page at Auth0 and do not receive any errors.
      </Note>

</Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6" isSingleColumn>
      Once users logs in with the Universal Login Page, they redirect back to your app via a URL with a custom URL
            scheme. The `appUrlOpen` event must be handled within your app. You can call the
            `handleRedirectCallback` method from the Auth0 SDK to initialize the authentication state.

      You can only use this method on a redirect from Auth0. To verify success, check for the presence of the
            `code` and `state` parameters in the URL.

      The `Browser.close()` method should close the browser when this event is raised.

      <Info>
      This article assumes you will be using Custom URL Schemes to handle the callback within your
                      application. To do this, register your `YOUR_PACKAGE_ID` as a URL scheme for your chosen
                      platform. To learn more, read [Defining a Custom URL Scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) for iOS, or [Create Deep Links to App Content](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) for Android.
      </Info>

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add the `appUrlOpen` to your application's `App` component setup and log in. The
                    browser window should close once the user authenticates and logs in to your app.
      </Note>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Main/>
            <Loginbutton/>

</Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7" isSingleColumn>
      Now that users can log in, you need to configure [a way to log out](https://auth0.com/docs/logout/guides/logout-auth0). Users must redirect to the Auth0 logout endpoint in the browser to clear
            their browser session. Again, Capacitor's Browser plugin should perform this redirect so that the user does not
            leave your app and receive a suboptimal experience.

      To achieve this with Ionic and Capacitor in conjunction with the Auth0 SDK:

      - Construct the URL for your app Auth0 should use to redirect to after logout. This is a URL that uses your
                registered custom scheme and Auth0 domain. Add it to your **Allowed Logout URLs **configuration in the
                Auth0 Dashboard
      - Logout from the SDK by calling `logout`, and pass your redirect URL back as the
                `logoutParams.returnTo`parameter.
      - Set the `openUrl`parameter to a callback that uses the Capacitor browser plugin to open the URL
                using `Browser.open`.

      <Info>
      Similar to the login step, if you do not set `openUrl` when calling `logout`, the
                      SDK redirects the user to the logout URL using the default browser application on the device, which
                      provides a suboptimal user experience.
      </Info>

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Provide a way for your users to log out of your application. Verify that you redirect to Auth0 and then
                    to the address you specified in the `returnTo` parameter. Check that you are no longer logged
                    in to your application.
      </Note>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Logoutbutton/>
            <Main/>
            <Loginbutton/>
            <Userprofile/>
          </AuthCodeGroup>
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[7].id} title={sections[7].title} stepNumber="8" isSingleColumn>
      The Auth0 Vue SDK retrieves the [user's profile](https://auth0.com/docs/users/concepts/overview-user-profile) associated with logged-in users in whatever component you need, such as their
            name or profile picture, to personalize the user interface. The profile information is available through the
            `user` property exposed by the `useAuth0()` composable.

      Initializing the SDK is asynchronous, and you should guard the user profile by checking the
            `isLoading` and `user` properties. Once `isLoading` is `false` and
            `user` has a value, the user profile can be used.

      <Note>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Provide a way for your users to see their user profile details within the app and verify you are able to
                    retrieve and see your profile information on screen once you have logged in.
      </Note>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Userprofile/>
            <Main/>
