    This guide demonstrates how to add authentication and access user profile information in any iOS / macOS app using
        the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) SDK.

    To use this quickstart, you need to:

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      To use Auth0 services, you need an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is where you
            will configure how you want authentication to work for the app you are developing.

      ### Configure an Auth0 application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing **Native** Auth0
            application. Auth0 assigns every application an alphanumeric, unique Client ID that your app uses to call Auth0
            APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart automatically update your Auth0 application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample app instead.

      ### Configure callback and logout URLs

      Auth0 invokes the callback and logout URLs to redirect users back to your app. Auth0 invokes the callback URL
            after authenticating the user and the logout URL after removing the session cookie. If you do not set the callback
            and login URLs, users will not be able to log in and out of the app, and your app will produce an error.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      On iOS 17.4+ and macOS 14.4+ it is possible to use Universal Links as callback and logout URLs. When
                      enabled, Auth0.swift will fall back to using a custom URL scheme on older iOS / macOS versions.

      **This feature requires Xcode 15.3+ and a paid Apple Developer account.**
      </Callout>

      Add the following URLs to **Callback URLs** and **Logout URLs**, depending on the platform of your app. If
            you have a custom domain, use this instead of your Auth0
            tenant’s domain.

      #### iOS

      ```
      https://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback,
      YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
      ```


      #### macOS

      ```
      https://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback,
      YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
      ```


      For example, if your iOS bundle identifier was `com.example.MyApp` and your Auth0 domain was
            `example.us.auth0.com`, then this value would be:

      ```
      https://example.us.auth0.com/ios/com.example.MyApp/callback,
      com.example.MyApp://example.us.auth0.com/ios/com.example.MyApp/callback
      ```


      ### Configure the associated domain

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      This step requires a paid Apple Developer account. It is needed to use Universal Links as callback and
                      logout URLs. Skip this step to use a custom URL scheme instead.
      </Callout>

      #### Configure the Team ID and bundle identifier

      Go to the [settings page](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/#/applications/) of your Auth0 application, scroll to the end, and open **Advanced
              Settings > Device Settings**. In the **iOS** section, set **Team ID** to your [Apple Team ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/) and **App ID** to your app's bundle identifier.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/62v9bB3bUVMw9XLND5lcMI/d7b81872d8b442a36bcdc412384c14b7/IOS_Settings_-_English.png" />
      </Frame>

      This will add your app to your Auth0 tenant's `apple-app-site-association` file.

      #### Add the associated domain capability

      In Xcode, go to the **Signing and Capabilities** [tab](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability) of your app's target settings, and press the **+
              Capability** button. Then select **Associated Domains**.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/72eVE104zKB5Q4NPnx6MCa/66c81ee64f104583bd00b9916778f989/ios-xcode-capabilities.png" />
      </Frame>

      Next, add the following [entry](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-an-associated-domain#Define-a-service-and-its-associated-domain) under **Associated Domains**:

      ```
      webcredentials:labs-fundtraining.us.auth0.com
      ```


      If you have a custom domain, use this instead of your
            Auth0 tenant’s domain.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For the associated domain to work, your app must be signed with your team certificate **even when
                        building for the iOS simulator**. Make sure you are using the Apple Team whose Team ID is configured
                      in the settings page of your Auth0 application.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      ### Using the Swift Package Manager

      Open the following menu item in Xcode:

      **File > Add Package Dependencies...**

      In the **Search or Enter Package URL** search box enter this URL:

      ```
      https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift
      ```

      Then, select the dependency rule and press **Add Package**.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For further reference on SPM, check its [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).
      </Callout>

      ### Using Cocoapods

      Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

      ```
      pod 'Auth0', '~> 2.0'
      ```

      Then, run `pod install`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For further reference on Cocoapods, check their [official documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
      </Callout>

      ### Using Carthage

      Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

      ```
      github "auth0/Auth0.swift" ~> 2.0
      ```


      Then, run `carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For further reference on Carthage, check their [official documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started).
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      The Auth0.swift SDK needs your Auth0 **domain** and **Client ID**. You can find these values in the [settings
              page](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/#/applications/) of your Auth0 application.

      - **domain**: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. If you have a custom domain, use this instead of your Auth0 tenant’s
                domain.
      - **Client ID**: The alphanumeric, unique ID of the Auth0 application you set up earlier in this quickstart.

      Create a `plist` file named `Auth0.plist` in your app bundle containing the Auth0 domain
            and Client ID values.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      You can also configure the SDK programmatically. Check the [README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift#configure-client-id-and-domain-programmatically) to learn more.
      </Callout>

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      You configured the Auth0.swift SDK. Run your app to verify that it is not producing any errors related to
                    the SDK.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      Import the `Auth0` module in the file where you want to present the login page. Then, present the Universal Login page in the action of your **Login**
            button.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      You can use async/await or Combine instead of the callback-based API. Check the [README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift#web-auth-login-ios--macos) to learn more.
      </Callout>

      </Frame>

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Press the **Login** button and verify that:

      - An [alert box](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift#sso-alert-box-ios--macos) shows up asking for consent.
      - Choosing **Continue **opens the Universal Login page in a Safari modal.
      - You can log in or sign up using a username and password or a social provider.
      - The Safari modal closes automatically afterward.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      Now that you can log in to your app, you need a way to [log out](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout). In the action of your **Logout** button, call the `clearSession()`
            method to clear the Universal Login session cookie.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Press the **Logout** button and verify that:

      - An alert box shows up asking for consent.
      - Choosing **Continue **opens a page in a Safari modal.
      - The Safari modal closes automatically soon after.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      The `Credentials` instance you obtained after logging in includes an ID token. The ID token contains the profile information
            associated with the logged-in user, such as their email and profile picture. You can use these details to
            personalize the user interface of your app.

      The Auth0.swift SDK includes a [utility](https://github.com/auth0/JWTDecode.swift) for decoding [JWTs](https://jwt.io/) like the ID token. Start by importing the `JWTDecode` module in
            the file where you want to access the user profile information. Then, use the `decode(jwt:)` method to
            decode the ID token and access the claims it contains.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      You can retrieve the latest user information with the `userInfo(withAccessToken:)` method.
                      Check the [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md#retrieve-user-information) to learn more.
      </Callout>

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Verify that you can access the `email`, `picture`, or any other claim after you have logged in.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
