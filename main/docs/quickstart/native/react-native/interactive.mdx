    This Quickstart is for the React Native framework. To integrate Auth0 into your Expo application, refer to the [Expo Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/react-native-expo/interactive).

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      To use Auth0 services, you must have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is where
            you will configure authentication in your project.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your Applications in the future.

      To explore a complete configuration, review the sample application in your Dashboard.

      ### Configure callback and logout URLs

      Auth0 invokes the callback and logout URLs to redirect users back to your application. Auth0 invokes the callback
            URL after authenticating the user and the logout URL after removing the session cookie. If you do not set the
            callback and logout URLs, users will not be able to log in and out of the app, and your application will produce
            an error.

      Add the corresponding URL to **Callback URLs** and **Logout URLs**, according to your app's platform. If
            you are using a custom domain, use the value of your custom
            domain instead of your Auth0 tenant’s domain.

      #### iOS

      ```
      BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER.auth0://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/ios/BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
      ```


      #### Android

      ```
      PACKAGE_NAME.auth0://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/android/PACKAGE_NAME/callback
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set the following for:

      - **iOS**: 
          `com.auth0samples.auth0://labs-fundtraining.us.auth0.com/ios/com.auth0samples/callback`
      - **Android**: 
          `com.auth0samples.auth0://labs-fundtraining.us.auth0.com/android/com.auth0samples/callback`
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      In this section, you will install the React Native Auth0 module.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      Refer to the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for additional details on React Native.
      </Callout>

      ### Yarn

      ```
      yarn add react-native-auth0
      ```

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      For further reference on yarn, check [their official documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs).
      </Callout>

      ### npm

      ```
      npm install react-native-auth0 --save
      ```


      ### Additional iOS step: install the module Pod

      Our SDK requires a minimum iOS deployment target of 13.0. In your project's `ios/Podfile``, ensure your platform
            target is set to 13.0.

      ```
      platform :ios '13.0'
      ```


      CocoaPods is the iOS package management tool the React Native framework uses to install itself into your project.
            For the iOS native module to work with your iOS app, first install the library Pod. If you're familiar with older
            React Native SDK versions, this is similar to the previous Linking a Native module. The process is now simplified:

      Change directory into the `ios` folder and run `pod install`.

      ```
      cd ios
      pod install
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      First, you must provide a way for your users to log in. We recommend using the Auth0-hosted login page.

      </Frame>

      ### Configure Android

      Open the `build.gradle` file in your application directory (typically at
            `android/app/build.gradle`) and add the following manifest placeholders. The value for
            `auth0Domain` should contain your Auth0 application settings as configured above.

      ```groovy lines
      android {
        defaultConfig {

            // Add the next line

            manifestPlaceholders = [auth0Domain: &quot;dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com&quot;, auth0Scheme: &quot;${applicationId}.auth0&quot;]

        }

        ...

      } 
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      At runtime, the `applicationId` value will automatically update with your application's
                      package name or ID (e.g. `com.example.app`). You can change this value from the
                      `build.gradle` file. You can also check it at the top of your
                      `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure iOS

      #### AppDelegate Setup (Choose Based on Architecture)

      If you're using (Swift - `ios/<YOUR PROJECT>/AppDelegat.swift`) add the following in
            `AppDelegate` class:

      ```text lines
      func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        return RCTLinkingManager.application(app, open: url, options: options)
      }
      ```


      If you're using (Objective-C++ - `ios/<YOUR PROJECT>/AppDelegate.mm`) add the following:

      ```text lines
      #import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>


      (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(NSDictionary&lt;UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey, id&gt; *)options



      {
      return [RCTLinkingManager application:app openURL:url options:options];
      }
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      This file will be `ios/<YOUR PROJECT>/AppDelegate.m` on applications using the [old architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/new-architecture-app-intro#ios---use-objective-c-mm-extension).
      </Callout>

      Next, add a URLScheme using your App's bundle identifier.

      In the `ios` folder, open the `Info.plist` and locate the value for
            `CFBundleIdentifier`.

      ```xml lines
      <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
      <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
      ```


      Below this value, register a URL type entry using the value of `CFBundleIdentifier` as the value for
            the `CFBundleURLSchemes`.

      ```xml lines
      <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
      <array>
      <dict>
      <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
      <string>None</string>
      <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
      <string>auth0</string>
      <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
      <array>
      <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER).auth0</string>
      </array>
      </dict>
      </array>
      ```


      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If your application was generated using the React Native CLI, the default value of
                      `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)` dynamically matches
                      `org.reactjs.native.example.$(PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier)`. For the sample app, this
                      value matches `com.auth0samples`.
      </Callout>

      In a later step, you will use this value to define the callback URLs below. You can change it using XCode with
            the following steps:

      - Open the `ios/<YOUR PROJECT>.xcodeproj`file or run `xed ios`on a Terminal from
                the app root.
      - Open your project's or desired target's Build Settings tab and find the section that contains "Bundle
                Identifier".
      - Replace the "Bundle Identifier" value with your desired application's bundle identifier name.

      For additional information, please read [react native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking).

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      The `useAuth0` hook relies on a React Context to provide state management. The
            `Auth0Provider` component provides this context.

      Import the `useAuth0` hook and `Auth0Provider` component from the
            `react-native-auth0` package:

      ```jsx lines
      import {useAuth0, Auth0Provider} from 'react-native-auth0';
      ```


      For the SDK to function correctly, wrap your application in the `Auth0Provider` component and set the
            following properties:

      - `domain`: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. Generally, you can find this in the Auth0 Dashboard
                under your Application's Settings in the Domain field. If you are using a custom domain, you should set this to the value of your
                custom domain instead.
      - `clientId`: The ID of the Auth0 Application you set up earlier in this quickstart. You can find
                this in the Auth0 Dashboard under your application's Settings tab in the Client ID field.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      You just configured the `Auth0Provider` component. Run your application to verify that:

      - The SDK is initializing correctly.
      - Your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      Authenticate the user by calling the `authorize` method provided by the `useAuth0` hook.
            This method redirects the user to the Auth0 Universal
              Login page for authentication, then back to your app.

      To confirm the user successfully logged in, check that the `user` property provided by the hook is not
            `null`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button component that calls `authorize` when clicked. Verify that you are redirected to
                    the login page and then back to your application.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      To log the user out, redirect them to the Auth0 logout endpoint by calling `clearSession`. This will
            remove their session from the authorization server and log the user out of the application.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Add a button that calls `clearSession` and observe that you are redirected to the Auth0 logout
                    endpoint and back again. You should no longer be logged in to your application.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7">
      The `useAuth0` hook exposes a `user` object that contains information about the
            authenticated user. You can use this to access decoded user profile information about the authenticated user from
            the ID token.

      If a user has not been authenticated, this property will be `null`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Log in and inspect the `user` property on the result. Verify the current user's profile
                    information, such as `email` or `name`.
      </Callout>
    </Section>

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
