    Auth0 allows you to add authentication to almost any application type quickly. This guide demonstrates how to
        integrate Auth0, add authentication, and display user profile information in any WPF and WinForms application using
        the Auth0 SDKs for [WPF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.OidcClient.WPF/) and [WinForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms).

    To use this quickstart, you’ll need to:

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1" isSingleColumn>
      To use Auth0 services, you’ll need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure how you want authentication to work for the project you are developing.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your Applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have
            authenticated. If not set, users will not be returned to your application after they log in.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `http://{yourDomain}:4200/mobile`.
      </Callout>

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have logged
            out. If not set, users will not be able to log out from your application and will receive an error.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" iconType="regular">
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `http://{yourDomain}:4200/mobile`.
      </Callout>
    
    <LoggedInForm />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2" isSingleColumn>
      Auth0 provides a [WPF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.OidcClient.WPF/) and [WinForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms) SDK to simplify the process of implementing Auth0
            authentication in WPF and WinForms applications.

      Use the NuGet Package Manager (Tools -> Library Package Manager -> Package Manager Console) to install the
            `Auth0.OidcClient.WPF` or `Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms` package, depending on whether you are
            building a WPF or Windows Forms application.

      Alternatively, you can use the NuGet Package Manager Console (`Install-Package`) or the
            `dotnet` CLI (`dotnet add`).

      ```
      Install-Package Auth0.OidcClient.WPF
      Install-Package Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms
      ```

      ```
      dotnet add Auth0.OidcClient.WPF
      dotnet add Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms
      ```
    
    <LoggedInForm />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3" isSingleColumn>
      To integrate Auth0 into your application, instantiate an instance of the Auth0Client class, passing an instance
            of Auth0ClientOptions that contains your Auth0 Domain and Client ID.

      By default, the SDK will leverage [WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) for .NET6 and above, while relying on the older WebView
            on applications using any version that predates .NET6.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Your `Auth0Client` should now be properly instantiated. Run your application to verify that:

      - The `Auth0Client`is instantiated correctly.
      - Your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0.
      </Callout>
    
    <MainwindowXaml />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4" isSingleColumn>
      Now that you have configured your Auth0 Application and the Auth0 SDK, you need to set up login for your project.
            To do this, you will use the SDK’s `LoginAsync()` method to create a login button that redirects users
            to the Auth0 Universal Login page. After a user successfully authenticates, they will be redirected to the
            callback URL you set up earlier in this quickstart.

      If there isn't any error, you can access the `User`, `IdentityToken`,
            `AccessToken` and `RefreshToken` on the `LoginResult` returned from
            `LoginAsync()`.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      You should now be able to log in or sign up using a username and password.

      Click the login button and verify that:

      - Your WPF or WinForms Application redirects you to the Auth0 Universal Login page.
      - You can log in or sign up.
      - Auth0 redirects you to your application.
      </Callout>
    
    <MainwindowXaml2 />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5" isSingleColumn>
      Users who log in to your project will also need a way to log out. Create a logout button using the SDK’s
            `LogoutAsync()` method. When users log out, they will be redirected to your Auth0 logout endpoint,
            which will then immediately redirect them back to the logout URL you set up earlier in this quickstart.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Run your application and click the logout button, verify that:

      - Your WPF or WinForms application redirects you to the address you specified as one of the Allowed
                        Logout URLs in your Application Settings.
      - You are no longer logged in to your application.
      </Callout>
    
    <MainwindowXaml3 />
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6" isSingleColumn>
      Now that your users can log in and log out, you will likely want to be able to retrieve the profile information associated with authenticated users.
            For example, you may want to display a logged-in user’s name or profile picture in your project.

      The Auth0 SDK for WPF and WinForms provides user information through the `LoginResult.User` property.

      <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
      ##### Checkpoint

      Verify that you can display the user's name or other user property after logging in.
      </Callout>
    
    <MainwindowXaml4 />
</Section>

    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
