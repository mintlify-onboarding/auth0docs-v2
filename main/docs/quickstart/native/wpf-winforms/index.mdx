This tutorial demonstrates how to add user login to a WPF and Windows Forms C# application using Auth0.We recommend that you log in to follow this quickstart with examples configured for your account.

<Info>
**New to Auth?** Learn [How Auth0 works](/docs/get-started/auth0-overview), how it [integrates with Native Applications](/docs/get-started/architecture-scenarios/mobile-api) and which [protocol](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce) it uses.

## Configure Auth0

### Get Your Application Keys

When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

<Frame>![App Dashboard](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/1.14550.0/media/articles/dashboard/client_settings.png)</Frame>

<Info>
When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
</Info>

You need the following information:

* **Domain**
* **Client ID**

<Info>
If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.
</Info>

### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.

<Info>
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should set the **Allowed Callback URLs** to `https://{yourDomain}/mobile`.
</Info>

### Configure Logout URLs

A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the application and will get an error.

<Info>
If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the logout URL you need to add to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field is `https://{yourDomain}/mobile`.
</Info>

## Integrate Auth0 in your Application

### Install Dependencies

The `Auth0.OidcClient.WPF` or `Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms` NuGet packages helps you authenticate users with any [Auth0 supported identity provider](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers).

Use the NuGet Package Manager (Tools -> Library Package Manager -> Package Manager Console) to install the `Auth0.OidcClient.WPF` or `Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms` package, depending on whether you are building a WPF or Windows Forms application:

## Trigger Authentication

To integrate Auth0 login into your application, simply instantiate an instance of the `Auth0Client` class, passing your Auth0 Domain and Client ID in the constructor.

export const codeExample = `// Form1.cs

using Auth0.OidcClient;

Auth0ClientOptions clientOptions = new Auth0ClientOptions
{
    Domain = "{yourDomain}",
    ClientId = "{yourClientId}"
};
client = new Auth0Client(clientOptions);
clientOptions.PostLogoutRedirectUri = clientOptions.RedirectUri;`;

<AuthCodeBlock children={codeExample} language="cs" />






You can then call the `LoginAsync` method to log the user in:

```cs lines
var loginResult = await client.LoginAsync();
```






<Frame>![](https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/1.14550.0/media/articles/native-platforms/wpf-winforms/universal-login.png)</Frame>

This will load the Auth0 login page into a web view. You can learn how to customize the login page in [this document](/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login#simple-customization).

## Handle Authentication Tokens

The returned login result will indicate whether authentication was successful, and if so contain the tokens and claims of the user.

### Authentication Error

You can check the `IsError` property of the result to see whether the login has failed. The `ErrorMessage` will contain more information regarding the error which occurred.

```cs lines
var loginResult = await client.LoginAsync();

if (loginResult.IsError)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"An error occurred during login: {loginResult.Error}");
}
```






### Accessing the tokens

On successful login, the login result will contain the ID Token and Access Token in the `IdentityToken` and `AccessToken` properties respectively.

```cs lines
var loginResult = await client.LoginAsync();

if (!loginResult.IsError)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"id_token: {loginResult.IdentityToken}");
    Debug.WriteLine($"access_token: {loginResult.AccessToken}");
}
```






### Obtaining the User Information

On successful login, the login result will contain the user information in the `User` property, which is a [ClaimsPrincipal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal(v=vs.110).aspx).

To obtain information about the user, you can query the claims. You can for example obtain the user's name and email address from the `name` and `email` claims:

```cs lines
if (!loginResult.IsError)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"name: {loginResult.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "name")?.Value}");
    Debug.WriteLine($"email: {loginResult.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "email")?.Value}");
}
```





<Info>
The exact claims returned will depend on the scopes that were requested. For more information see @scopes.
</Info>

You can obtain a list of all the claims contained in the ID Token by iterating through the `Claims` collection:

```cs lines
if (!loginResult.IsError)
{
    foreach (var claim in loginResult.User.Claims)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine($"{claim.Type} = {claim.Value}");
    }
}
```






## Logout

To log the user out call the `LogoutAsync` method.

```cs lines
await client.LogoutAsync();
```
