    Auth0 allows you to add authentication to almost any application type quickly. This guide demonstrates how to
        integrate Auth0, add user login, logout, and profile to a Node.js Express application using the Express OpenID
        Connect SDK.

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      To use Auth0 services, you’ll need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure how you want authentication to work for the project you are developing.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your Applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have
            authenticated. If not set, users will not be returned to your application after they log in.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
      </Info>

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have logged
            out. If not set, users will not be able to log out from your application and will receive an error.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to `http://localhost:3000/`.
      </Info>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Your application will need the [express-openid-connect](https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect) package which is an Auth0-maintained
            OIDC-compliant SDK for Express.

      Install the Express OpenID Connect SDK by running the following commands in your terminal:

      ```sh lines
      cd <your-project-directory>
      npm install express-openid-connect
      ```

      

      ### Configure Router

      The Express OpenID Connect library provides the `auth` router in order to attach authentication routes
            to your application. You will need to configure the router with the following configuration keys:

      - `authRequired` - Controls whether authentication is required for all routes.
      - `auth0Logout` - Uses Auth0 logout feature.
      - `baseURL` - The URL where the application is served.
      - `secret` - A long, random string.
      - `issuerBaseURL` - The Domain as a secure URL found in your <AuthLink href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings">Application settings</AuthLink>.
      - `clientID` - The Client ID found in your <AuthLink href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/{yourClientId}/settings">Application settings</AuthLink>.

      For additional configuration options visit the [API documentation](https://auth0.github.io/express-openid-connect).

      <Info>
      You can generate a suitable string for `LONG_RANDOM_STRING` using
                      `openssl rand -hex 32` on the command line.
      </Info>

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      A user can now log into your application by visiting the `/login` route provided by the
                    library. If you are running your project on `localhost:3000`, that link would be [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login).
      </Info>
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      To display the user's profile, your application should provide a protected route.

      Add the `requiresAuth` middleware for routes that require authentication. Any route using this
            middleware will check for a valid user session and, if one does not exist, it will redirect the user to log in.

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      A user can log out of your application by visiting the `/logout` route provided by the
                    library. If you are running your project on `localhost:3000`, that link would be [http://localhost:3000/logout](http://localhost:3000/logout).
      </Info>
    </Section>

      ## Next Steps

      Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
