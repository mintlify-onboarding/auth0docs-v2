Auth0's Laravel SDK allows you to quickly add authentication, user profile management, and routing access control to your Laravel application. This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with a new or existing Laravel 9 or 10 application.We recommend that you log in to follow this quickstart with examples configured for your account.

System requirements: Laravel 9 / 10 | PHP 8.0+ | Composer
</Card> */}
## Laravel Installation

**If you do not already have a Laravel application set up**, open a shell to a suitable directory for a new project and run the following command:

```bash lines
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel auth0-laravel-app ^9.0
```






All the commands in this guide assume you are running them from the root of your Laravel project, directory so you should `cd` into the new project directory:

```bash lines
cd auth0-laravel-app
```






## SDK Installation

Run the following command within your project directory to install the [Auth0 Laravel SDK](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0):

```bash lines
composer require auth0/login:^7.8 --update-with-all-dependencies
```






Then generate an SDK configuration file for your application:

```bash lines
php artisan vendor:publish --tag auth0
```






## SDK Configuration

Run the following command from your project directory to download the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli):

```bash lines
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0/auth0-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b .
```






Then authenticate the CLI with your Auth0 account, choosing "as a user" when prompted:

```bash lines
./auth0 login
```






Next, create a new application with Auth0:

```bash lines
./auth0 apps create \
  --name "My Laravel Application" \
  --type "regular" \
  --auth-method "post" \
  --callbacks "http://localhost:8000/callback" \
  --logout-urls "http://localhost:8000" \
  --reveal-secrets \
  --no-input \
  --json > .auth0.app.json
```






You should also create a new API:

```bash lines
./auth0 apis create \
  --name "My Laravel Application's API" \
  --identifier "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0" \
  --offline-access \
  --no-input \
  --json > .auth0.api.json
```






This produces two files in your project directory that configure the SDK.

As these files contain credentials it's important to treat these as sensitive. You should ensure you do not commit these to version control. If you're using Git, you should add them to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash lines
echo ".auth0.*.json" >> .gitignore
```






## Login Routes

The SDK automatically registers all the necessary routes for your application's users to authenticate.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Route</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>/login</code></td>
<td>Initiates the authentication flow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/logout</code></td>
<td>Logs the user out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/callback</code></td>
<td>Handles the callback from Auth0.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you require more control over these, or if they conflict with existing routes in your application, you can manually register the SDK's controllers instead. Please see [the SDKs README](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0) for advanced integrations.

## Access Control

Laravel's authentication facilities use "guards" to define how users are authenticated for each request. You can use the Auth0 SDK's authentication guard to restrict access to your application's routes.

To require users to authenticate before accessing a route, you can use Laravel's `auth` middleware:

```php lines
Route::get('/private', function () {
  return response('Welcome! You are logged in.');
})->middleware('auth');
```






You can also require authenticated users to have specific [permissions](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac) by combining this with Laravel's `can` middleware:

```php lines
Route::get('/scope', function () {
    return response('You have the `read:messages` permissions, and can therefore access this resource.');
})->middleware('auth')->can('read:messages');
```






## User Information

Information about the authenticated user is available through Laravel's `Auth` Facade, or the `auth()` helper function.

For example, to retrieve the user's identifier and email address:

```php lines
Route::get('/', function () {
  if (! auth()->check()) {
    return response('You are not logged in.');
  }

  $user = auth()->user();
  $name = $user->name ?? 'User';
  $email = $user->email ?? '';

  return response("Hello {$name}! Your email address is {$email}.");
});
```






## User Management

You can update user information using the [Auth0 Management API](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/blob/main/docs/Management.md). All Management endpoints are accessible through the SDK's `management()` method.

**Before making Management API calls you must enable your application to communicate with the Management API.** This can be done from the [Auth0 Dashboards API page](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis/), choosing `Auth0 Management API`, and selecting the 'Machine to Machine Applications' tab. Authorize your Laravel application, and then click the down arrow to choose the scopes you wish to grant.

For the following example, in which we will update a user's metadata and assign a random favorite color, you should grant the `read:users` and `update:users` scopes. A list of API endpoints and the required scopes can be found in [the Management API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

```php lines
use Auth0\Laravel\Facade\Auth0;

Route::get('/colors', function () {
  $endpoint = Auth0::management()->users();

  $colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'white', 'yellow', 'purple', 'orange', 'pink', 'brown'];

  $endpoint->update(
    id: auth()->id(),
    body: [
        'user_metadata' => [
            'color' => $colors[random_int(0, count($colors) - 1)]
        ]
    ]
  );

  $metadata = $endpoint->get(auth()->id());
  $metadata = Auth0::json($metadata);

  $color = $metadata['user_metadata']['color'] ?? 'unknown';
  $name = auth()->user()->name;

  return response("Hello {$name}! Your favorite color is {$color}.");
})->middleware('auth');
```






A quick reference guide of all the SDK's Management API methods is [available here](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/blob/main/docs/Management.md).

## Run the Application

You are now ready to start your Laravel application, so it can accept requests:

```bash lines
php artisan serve
```






### Checkpoint

Open your web browser and try accessing the following routes:

* `http://localhost:8000` to see the public route.
* `http://localhost:8000/private` to be prompted to authenticate.
* `http://localhost:8000` to see the pubic route, now authenticated.
* `http://localhost:8000/scope` to check if you have the `read:messages` [permission](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac).
* `http://localhost:8000/update` to update the user's profile.
* `http://localhost:8000/logout` to log out.

If you have any issues, here are a couple of things to try:

* Try running `php artisan optimize:clear` to clear Laravel's cache.
* Ensure your `.auth0.app.json` and `.auth0.api.json` files are at the root of your project.
* Ensure you have enabled your Laravel application as a Machine-to-Machine application and granted it all the necessary scopes for the `Auth0 Management API` from the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis/).
