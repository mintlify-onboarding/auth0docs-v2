    [Auth0's Laravel SDK](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0)
        allows you to quickly add authentication, user profile management, and routing access control to your Laravel
        application. This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with a new (or existing) [Laravel 9
          or 10](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0#support-policy) application.

    Test Change

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      **If you do not already have a Laravel application set up**, open a shell to a suitable directory for a new
            project and run the following command:

      ```sh wrap lines
      composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel auth0-laravel-app ^9.0
      ```


      All the commands in this guide assume you are running them from the root of your Laravel project, directory so
            you should `cd` into the new project directory:

      ```sh lines
      cd auth0-laravel-app
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[1].id} title={sections[1].title} stepNumber="2">
      Run the following command within your project directory to install the [Auth0 Laravel SDK](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0):

      ```sh wrap lines
      composer require auth0/login:^7.8 --update-with-all-dependencies
      ```


      Then generate an SDK configuration file for your application:

      ```sh lines
      php artisan vendor:publish --tag auth0
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      Run the following command from your project directory to download the Auth0 CLI:

      ```sh wrap lines
      curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0/auth0-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b .
      ```


      Then authenticate the CLI with your Auth0 account, choosing "as a user" when prompted:

      ```sh lines
      ./auth0 login
      ```


      Next, create a new application with Auth0:

      ```sh lines
      ./auth0 apps create \
        --name "My Laravel Application" \
        --type "regular" \
        --auth-method "post" \
        --callbacks "http://localhost:8000/callback" \
        --logout-urls "http://localhost:8000" \
        --reveal-secrets \
        --no-input \
        --json > .auth0.app.json
      ```


      You should also create a new API:

      ```sh lines
      ./auth0 apis create \
        --name "My Laravel Application's API" \
        --identifier "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0" \
        --offline-access \
        --no-input \
        --json > .auth0.api.json
      ```


      This produces two files in your project directory that configure the SDK.

      As these files contain credentials it's important to treat these as sensitive. You should ensure you do not
            commit these to version control. If you're using Git, you should add them to your `.gitignore` file:

      ```sh lines
      echo ".auth0.*.json" >> .gitignore
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      The SDK automatically registers all the necessary routes for your application's users to authenticate.

      If you require more control over these, or if they conflict with existing routes in your application, you can
            manually register the SDK's controllers instead. Please see [the SDK's README](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0) for advanced integrations.
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      Laravel's authentication facilities use "guards" to define how users are authenticated for each request. You can
            use the Auth0 SDK's authentication guard to restrict access to your application's routes.

      To require users to authenticate before accessing a route, you can use Laravel's `auth` middleware.

      ```text lines
      Route::get('/private', function () {
        return response('Welcome! You are logged in.');
      })->middleware('auth');
      ```


      You can also require authenticated users to have specific [permissions](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac) by combining this
            with Laravel's `can` middleware.

      ```text lines
      Route::get('/scope', function () {
        return response('You have `read:messages` permission, and can therefore access this resource.');

      })->middleware('auth')->can('read:messages');
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      Information about the authenticated user is available through Laravel's `Auth` Facade, or the
            `auth()` helper function.

      For example, to retrieve the user's identifier and email address:

      ```text lines
      Route::get('/', function () {
        if (! auth()->check()) {
        return response('You are not logged in.');

        }
        $user = auth()->user();
        $name = $user->name ?? 'User';
        $email = $user->email ?? '';
        return response("Hello {$name}! Your email address is {$email}.");
      });;
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[6].id} title={sections[6].title} stepNumber="7">
      You can update user information using the [Auth0 Management API](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/blob/main/docs/Management.md). All Management endpoints are accessible through the SDK's
            `management()` method.

      **Before making Management API calls you must enable your application to communicate with the Management
              API.** This can be done from the [Auth0 Dashboard's API page](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq/apis/), choosing
            `Auth0 Management API`, and selecting the 'Machine to Machine Applications' tab. Authorize your Laravel
            application, and then click the down arrow to choose the scopes you wish to grant.

      For the following example, in which we will update a user's metadata and assign a random favorite color, you
            should grant the `read:users` and `update:users` scopes. A list of API endpoints and the
            required scopes can be found in [the Management
              API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

      ```text lines
      use Auth0\Laravel\Facade\Auth0;
      Route::get('/colors', function () {
      $endpoint = Auth0::management()->users();
      $colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'white', 'yellow', 'purple', 'orange', 'pink', 'brown'];
      $endpoint->update(
      id: auth()-&gt;id(),

      body: [

          'user_metadata' =&gt; [

              'color' =&gt; $colors[random_int(0, count($colors) - 1)]

          ]

      ]

      );
      $metadata = $endpoint->get(auth()->id());
      $metadata = Auth0::json($metadata);
      $color = $metadata['user_metadata']['color'] ?? 'unknown';
      $name = auth()->user()->name;
      return response("Hello {$name}! Your favorite color is {$color}.");
      })->middleware('auth');
      ```

    <Section id={sections[7].id} title={sections[7].title} stepNumber="8">
      You are now ready to start your Laravel application, so it can accept requests:

      ```text lines
      php artisan serve
      ```

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Open your web browser and try accessing the following routes:

      - [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
                        to see the public route.
      - [http://localhost:8000/private](http://localhost:8000/private) to be prompted to authenticate.
      - [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
                        to see the public route, now authenticated.
      - [http://localhost:8000/scope](http://localhost:8000/scope) to check if you have the
                        `read:messages`[permission](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac).
      - [http://localhost:8000/update](http://localhost:8000/update) to update the user's profile.
      - [http://localhost:8000/logout](http://localhost:8000/logout) to log out.
      </Info>
