    Auth0 allows you to add authentication to almost any application type quickly. This guide demonstrates how to
        integrate Auth0, add authentication, and display user profile information in any PHP application using the Auth0 PHP
        SDK.

    To use this quickstart, you’ll need to:

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1" isSingleColumn>
      To use Auth0 services, you’ll need to have an application set up in the Auth0 Dashboard. The Auth0 application is
            where you will configure how you want authentication to work for the project you are developing.

      ### Configure an application

      Use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 application or select an existing application that represents
            the project you want to integrate with. Every application in Auth0 is assigned an alphanumeric, unique client ID
            that your application code will use to call Auth0 APIs through the SDK.

      Any settings you configure using this quickstart will automatically update for your Application in the [Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/), which is where you
            can manage your Applications in the future.

      If you would rather explore a complete configuration, you can view a sample application instead.

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have
            authenticated. If not set, users will not be returned to your application after they log in.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to
                      `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
      </Info>

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after they have logged
            out. If not set, users will not be able to log out from your application and will receive an error.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Info>

      ### Configure Allowed Web Origins

      An Allowed Web Origin is a URL that you want to be allowed to access to your authentication flow. This must
            contain the URL of your project. If not properly set, your project will be unable to silently refresh
            authentication tokens, so your users will be logged out the next time they visit your application or refresh a
            page.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with our sample project, set this to `http://localhost:3000`.

      Auth0 provides a [PHP
              SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP) (Auth0-PHP) to simplify the process of implementing Auth0 authentication and authorization in PHP apps.

      The Auth0 PHP SDK requires [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) compatible HTTP libraries to be installed for managing network requests. If
            you don't have libraries available, you can install reliable choices by running the following commands in your
            terminal:

      ```text lines
      cd <your-project-directory>
      composer require symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7
      ```

      

      Now install the Auth0 PHP SDK by running the following command in your terminal:

      ```text lines
      composer require auth0/auth0-php
      ```

      

      ### Configure the Auth0 SDK

      Create a new file in your application called `index.php`, and copy in the code from the interactive
            panel to the right under the **index.php** tab.

      For the SDK to function properly, you must set the following properties in the Auth0 SDK during initialization:

      - `domain`: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. Generally, you can find this in the Auth0 Dashboard
                under your Application's Settings in the Domain field. If you are using a [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), you should set this to the
                value of your custom domain instead.
      - `clientId`: The ID of the Auth0 Application you set up earlier in this quickstart. You can find
                this in the Auth0 Dashboard under your Application's Settings in the Client ID field.
      - `clientSecret`: The secret of the Auth0 Application you set up earlier in this quickstart. You can
                find this in the Auth0 Dashboard under your Application's Settings in the Client Secret field.
      - `redirectUri`: The URL in your application that you would like Auth0 to redirect users to after
                they have authenticated. This corresponds to the callback URL you set up earlier in this quickstart. You can
                also find this value in the Auth0 Dashboard under your Application's Settings in the Callback URLs field. Make
                sure what you enter in your code matches what you set up earlier or your users will see an error.
      - `cookieSecret`: A long secret value used to encrypt the session cookie. You can generate a
                suitable string by running `openssl rand -hex 32`in your terminal.

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Your Auth0 SDK should now be properly configured. Run your application to verify that:

      - The SDK is initializing correctly.
      - Your application is not throwing any errors related to Auth0.
      </Info>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Index/>
            <Login/>
            <Logout/>
            <Profile/>
            <Router/>
            <Callback/>
          </AuthCodeGroup>
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3" isSingleColumn>
      Now install a routing library, to help direct incoming requests to your application. This isn't a required step,
            but simplifies our application structure for the purposes of this quickstart.

      ```text lines
      composer require steampixel/simple-php-router
      ```

      

      Create a new file in your application called `router.php` to define our routes, and copy in the code
            from the interactive panel to the right.
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Router/>
            <Index/>
            <Login/>
            <Logout/>
            <Profile/>
            <Callback/>
          </AuthCodeGroup>
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4" isSingleColumn>
      Now that you have configured your Auth0 Application and the Auth0 PHP SDK, you need to set up login for your
            project. To do this, you will use the SDK’s `login()` method to create a login button that redirects
            users to the Auth0 Universal Login page. After a user successfully authenticates, they will be redirected to the
            callback URL you set up earlier in this quickstart.

      Create a new file in your application called `login.php` to handle logging process, and copy in the
            code from the interactive panel to the right, which contains the logic needed for login.

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      You should now be able to log in or sign up using a username and password.

      Click the login link and verify that:

      - Your application redirects you to the Auth0 Universal Login page.
      - You can log in or sign up.
      - Auth0 redirects you back to your application using the value of the `redirectUri`you used
                        to configure the SDK.
      </Info>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Login/>
            <Index/>
            <Logout/>
            <Profile/>
            <Router/>
            <Callback/>
          </AuthCodeGroup>
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5" isSingleColumn>
      Users who log in to your project will also need a way to log out. We will handle a logout button using the SDK’s
            `logout()` method. When users log out, they will be redirected to your [Auth0 logout](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication?http#logout) endpoint, which
            will then immediately redirect them to the logout URL you set up earlier in this quickstart.

      Create a new file in your application called `logout.php` for handling the process, and copy in the
            code from the interactive panel, which contains the logic needed for logout. Then, update your
            `index.php` file to include the logout button.

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Run your application and click the logout button, verify that:

      - Your application redirects you to the address you specified as one of the Allowed Logout URLs in your
                        Application Settings.
      - You are no longer logged in to your application.
      </Info>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Logout/>
            <Index/>
            <Login/>
            <Profile/>
            <Router/>
            <Callback/>
          </AuthCodeGroup>
</Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6" isSingleColumn>
      Now that your users can log in and log out, you will likely want to be able to retrieve the [profile information](https://auth0.com/docs/users/concepts/overview-user-profile)
            associated with authenticated users. For example, you may want to be able to display a logged-in user’s name or
            profile picture in your project.

      The Auth0 PHP SDK provides user information through the `getCredentials()` method. Review the
            `profile.php` code in the interactive panel to see an example of how to use it.

      Because the method contains sensitive information related to the user's identity, its availability depends on the
            user's authentication status. To prevent render errors, you should always check if the
            `getCredentials()` method returns an `object` or `null` to determine whether
            Auth0 has authenticated the user before your application consumes the results.

      <Info>
      ##### Checkpoint

      Verify that:

      - You can display the `nickname`or any other user property correctly after you have logged
                        in.
      </Info>
    
    <AuthCodeGroup>
            <Profile/>
            <Index/>
            <Login/>
            <Logout/>
            <Router/>
            <Callback/>
          </AuthCodeGroup>
</Section>

      ## Next Steps

      Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
