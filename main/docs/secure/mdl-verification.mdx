Auth0’s Mobile Driver's License Verification Service is in Early Access. To enable this feature, review and complete the [Terms and Conditions form](https://forms.gle/47YuFPkhh3RZVvt76), and our team will be in contact with you. To learn more about Auth0’s release stages, read Product Release Stages.

Auth0’s Mobile Driver's License Verification Service allows you to initiate a verification request for a user’s Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Verifiable Credential. Verifiable Credentials (VC) are defined by Annex A of the [ISO/IEC TS 18013-7:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/82772.html) (REST API) and may contain sensitive user data or personally identifiable information (PII), such as birthdate or country of residence. To learn more about mDL, read [What is a Mobile Driver’s License?](https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-mdl-how-to-start-using-them/)

You can use Auth0’s Mobile Driver's License Verification Service in your application if you want your users to present an mDL. You can embed the Mobile Driver's License Verification API in your application, which allows your application to perform ad-hoc mDL verifications on end-user’s submitted credentials. Rather than embed the mDL Verification API to your app, you can use Auth0 Forms as a low-code solution to use the mDL Verification Service.

### Use cases

You can use the mDL Verification Service for:

* Age verification
* License and driving privileges validation
* Identity verification since many countries use a driver's license as proof of identity. The mDL is the digital equivalent.
* Business process improvements involving Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

## How it works

1. Your application initiates a Verification Presentation Request to Auth0 by making a call to the Mobile Driver's License Verification API.
2. The mDL Verification API returns an engagement URI and Verification ID from Auth0.
3. Your application presents the user with the URI link to prompt for consent to share their credential.

   <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

   We recommend you generate a QR code for the engagement URI to provide a convenient user experience if the user is on a device without a digital wallet, such as a tablet or desktop. To learn more, review the [Next.js example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-qrcode).

4. The user consents to sharing the mDL VC.
5. Your application polls the presentation request with the Mobile Driver's License Verification API.
6. The Mobile Driver's License Verification API returns the appropriate response.

## Validate Verifiable Credentials

The Verification Template (VT) you create defines the fields you ask the user’s digital wallet to provide, such as date of birth, address, or family name. The Verification Presentation Request created by your application initiates a verification flow by calling the mDL Verification API.

Your app must poll the Verification Presentation Request status via the Mobile Driver's License Verification API to determine if the user consented to sharing their credential. The API returns a status depending on if the presentation request is ongoing, unsuccessful, or successful. If successful, the API will return the `JSON` from the presentation request.

To learn more about configuring Auth0’s Mobile Driver's License Verification Service, read [Configure Mobile Driver’s License Verification Presentation Request](/docs/secure/mdl-verification/configure-mdl-verification-request).

### Mobile Driver's License Verification API

The Mobile Driver's License Verification API consumes the verification presentation request and returns an engagement URI and Verification ID. When your application polls the status of the verification presentation request, the mDL Verification API returns a status of successful, unsuccessful, or ongoing. You can embed the mDL Verification API in your application or use the [Auth0 Forms widget](/docs/customize/forms/nodes-and-components#widgets-components).

You need to configure an instance of the Verifiable Digital Credential API via <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> or <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>. To learn how, read [Create the Mobile Driver's License Verification API](/docs/secure/mdl-verification/create-mdl-api).

## Conditional Checks

You may want to check if a previous Verification Presentation Request was performed and is still valid. Conditional checks allow you to obtain data from a previous request or just verify the data from a previous request is sufficient. You can initiate a conditional verification check with Auth0 Actions. To learn more, read [Mobile Driver's License Conditional Verification Check](/docs/secure/mdl-verification/mdl-conditional-check).
