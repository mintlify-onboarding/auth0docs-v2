Auth0’s Mobile Driver's License Verification Service is in Early Access. To enable this feature, review and complete the [Terms and Conditions form](https://forms.gle/47YuFPkhh3RZVvt76), and our team will be in contact with you. To learn more about Auth0’s release stages, read Product Release Stages.

</Callout>

Auth0 supports verification of user's Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mDL) based on Annex A of the [ISO/IEC TS 18013-7:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/82772.html) standard. mDL verification allows customers to validate sensitive information or personally identifying information (PII) about a user, such as birthdate or country of residence. A conditional check may be required during a transaction.

You can store the response of a Verification Request, either with Auth0’s [metadata solution](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/metadata) or with your own storage solution. The storage of this data can be used to conditionally check if a verification request is needed or can be skipped. To learn more, read [Configure Mobile Driver’s License Verification Presentation Request](/docs/secure/mdl-verification/configure-mdl-verification-request).

<Warning>

Auth0 metadata is not a secure data store and should not be used to store sensitive information. This includes secrets and high-risk PII like social security numbers or credit card numbers, etc. Auth0 customers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the data stored in metadata and only store that which is necessary for identity and access management purposes. To learn more, read [Auth0 General Data Protection Regulation Compliance](/docs/secure/data-privacy-and-compliance/gdpr).

</Warning>

We recommend the use of [Actions](/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/metadata/manage-user-metadata) as a means to check if a previous Verification Request was performed, is still valid, and/or the data obtained from a previous request is sufficient.
