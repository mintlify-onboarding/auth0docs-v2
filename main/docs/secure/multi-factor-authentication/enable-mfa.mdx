You can enable <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=multi-factor+authentication">multi-factor authentication</Tooltip> (MFA) for your tenant in the <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>.

When you enable MFA, select the factors (such as push notifications or phone messages) you intend to make available to users and define a policy to determine when you require them to authenticate.

## Select factors

Auth0 supports a variety of factors you can enable for your users to complete authentication.

### Independent factors

You must enable and configure at least one independent factor to require MFA for users on your tenant. You may enable multiple independent factors simultaneously as you’d like.

Available independent factors are:

* [WebAuthn with FIDO Security Keys](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/fido-authentication-with-webauthn/configure-webauthn-security-keys-for-mfa)
* [One-time Password (OTP)](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors/configure-otp-notifications-for-mfa)
* [Push Notification using Auth0 Guardian](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors/configure-push-notifications-for-mfa)
* [Phone Message](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors/configure-sms-voice-notifications-mfa)
* [Cisco Duo Security](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/configure-cisco-duo-for-mfa)

### Dependent factors

You may enable one or more dependent factors once you’ve already enabled and configured at least one independent factor for users on your tenant.

Available dependent factors are:

* [WebAuthn with FIDO Biometrics](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/fido-authentication-with-webauthn/configure-webauthn-device-biometrics-for-mfa)
* [Email](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors/configure-email-notifications-for-mfa)
* [Recovery Code](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/configure-recovery-codes-for-mfa)

## Enable MFA in the Auth0 Dashboard

1. Go to [Dashboard > Security > Multi-factor Auth](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/mfa).
2. In the **Factors** section, enable and configure the factors you’d like to make available to users.
3. In the **Define policies** section, select a policy to determine when users will be prompted for MFA.

   * **Never**: MFA is not required for any logins.
   * **Use Adaptive MFA**: MFA is required based on Auth0 risk determination. To learn more, read [Enable Adaptive MFA](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/adaptive-mfa).
   * **Always**: MFA is required for all logins.
4. If you choose the **Never** or **Always** policy, the **MFA Risk Assessors** section appears. By default, the **Enable Adaptive MFA Risk Assessment** setting is disabled. Enable the toggle to assess and record risk for all login transactions in your tenant logs.
5. In the **Additional Settings** section, configure the following options as needed:

   * **Show Multi-factor Authentication options:** Enable this toggle to allow users to select authentication factors upon enrollment. When disabled, Auth0 automatically presents the most secure authentication factors to users upon enrollment.

   * **Customize MFA Factors using Actions**: Enable this toggle to customize your MFA flows using `post-login` [Actions](/docs/customize/actions). This allows you to challenge users with a specific factor or sequence of factors, as well as use contextual information to create more individualized experiences. To learn more, review [Customize MFA Selection for Universal Login](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa/customize-mfa-selection-universal-login).
6. Click **Save**.

## Customize MFA flow

You can use Auth0 Actions to customize the MFA flow for users on your tenant. For example, you can create an Action to require MFA in specific circumstances or to force a particular factor to be used.

To learn more, read [Customize Adaptive MFA](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/adaptive-mfa/customize-adaptive-mfa).
