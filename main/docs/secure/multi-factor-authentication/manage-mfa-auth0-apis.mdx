Auth0 provides two different APIs to help you and your users manage <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> authentication factors.

## Auth0 Authentication API

Use the [Authentication API Multi-factor Authentication endpoints](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#multi-factor-authentication) to allow your users to manage their own MFA authentication factors.

This method relies on authenticating using the <Tooltip tip="Resource Owner: Entity (such as a user or application) capable of granting access to a protected resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Resource+Owner">Resource Owner</Tooltip> Password Grant (ROPG) authentication flow. To learn more, read [Manage Authentication Factors with Authentication API](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/manage-mfa-auth0-apis/manage-authenticator-factors-mfa-api).

## Auth0 Management API

Use the [Management API Users endpoints](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) to manage your users' MFA authentication factors.

This method relies on authenticating using a confidential application. To learn more, read [Manage Authentication Methods with Management API](/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/manage-mfa-auth0-apis/manage-authentication-methods-with-management-api).
