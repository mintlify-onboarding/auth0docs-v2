* Insecure default algorithm in <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=jwt">jwt</Tooltip>.verify() could lead to signature validation bypass: [CVE-2022-23540](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken/security/advisories/GHSA-qwph-4952-7xr6)
