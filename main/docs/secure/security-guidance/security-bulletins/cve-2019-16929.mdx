## Overview

Versions of [auth0.net](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net) and associated NuGet Package [Auth0.AuthenticationAPI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.AuthenticationApi/) from `5.8.0` to `6.5.3` inclusive include a class named `IdentityTokenValidator` with a public `ValidateAsync` method, that performs limited validation suitable only for auth0 issued tokens.

## Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

* You are using the `IdentityTokenValidator` to validate untrusted <Tooltip tip="ID Token: Credential meant for the client itself, rather than for accessing a resource." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=ID+tokens">ID tokens</Tooltip>
* You are using a version of Auth0.AuthenticationAPI between `5.8.0` and `6.5.3` inclusive

## How to fix that?

Developers should not use the `IdentityTokenValidator` class to validate untrusted ID tokens. See [Validate ID Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens/validate-id-tokens) for our recommendations for validating ID tokens. https://jwt.io/ is a good resource on open source <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=JWT">JWT</Tooltip> validation libraries and their capabilities. Note that additional logic may be required based upon your use case.

Developers using the [auth0.net](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net) and associated NuGet Package [Auth0.AuthenticationAPI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.AuthenticationApi/) between `5.8.0` and `6.5.3` inclusive should upgrade to the latest version `6.5.4` to prevent accidental usage of the `IdentityTokenValidator` class.

### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the client library that your application runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.
