## Overview

Versions before and including 2.27.0 use a block list of specific keys that should be sanitized from the request object contained in the error object. When a request to Auth0 <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=management+API">management API</Tooltip> fails, the key for `Authorization` header is not sanitized and the `Authorization` header value can be logged exposing a bearer token.

## Am I affected?

## How to fix that?
