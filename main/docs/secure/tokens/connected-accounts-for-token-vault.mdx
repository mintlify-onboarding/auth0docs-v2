Connected Accounts enables applications to securely access external APIs on the user’s behalf through [Token Vault](/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault). While standard user authentication handles user login through a social or enterprise identity provider, Connected Accounts links a user profile to external services like Google, GitHub, Slack, and more, facilitating delegated access to external APIs on the user’s behalf. 

Once a user successfully connects and authorizes access to a [supported external provider](/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault#supported-external-providers), Auth0 securely stores the following: 
* The account on the user profile as a connected account.
* The external provider’s access and refresh tokens for that connected account in the Token Vault.

Connected Accounts creates and manages a unified Auth0 user profile linked to multiple external accounts, where users can log in to any one of their accounts using a single set of credentials. Your application then fetches the stored credentials in Token Vault to interact with external APIs on the user’s behalf.
