---

Connected Accounts for Token Vault enables applications to securely access external APIs on the user’s behalf through [Token Vault](/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault). While standard user authentication handles user login through a social or enterprise identity provider, Connected Accounts links a user profile to external services like Google, GitHub, Slack, and more, facilitating delegated access to external APIs on the user’s behalf. 

Once a user successfully connects and authorizes access to a [supported external provider](/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault#supported-external-providers), Auth0: 
* Associates the account with the user as a connected account.
* Stores the external provider’s access and refresh tokens for the connected account in the Token Vault.

Connected Accounts for Token Vault creates and manages a unified Auth0 user profile linked to multiple external accounts, enabling seamless authorization. Your application then fetches the stored credentials in Token Vault to interact with external APIs on the user’s behalf.

## User authentication vs Connected Accounts

When you [configure Connected Accounts](#configure-connected-accounts) for a supported social or enterprise connection, Auth0 uses the Connected Accounts flow (`/me/v1/connected-accounts` endpoint) to retrieve and store access and refresh tokens in the Token Vault instead of using the social or enterprise login flow (`/authorize` endpoint). After successfully completing the Connected Accounts flow, Auth0 adds the user account to the `connected_accounts` array on the user profile. In contrast, for the social or enterprise login flow, Auth0 adds the user account to the `identities` array on the user profile.

The following table explains the differences between the user authentication and Connected Accounts flows:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>User Authentication</strong></th>
<th><strong>Connected Accounts</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Flow</td>
<td>Login flow using the `/authorize` endpoint</td>
<td>Connected Accounts flow using the My Account API’s `/me/v1/connected-accounts` endpoint</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>Authenticates users with a social or enterprise identity provider</td>
<td>Stores the access and refresh tokens for the connected account in Token Vault when a user logs in via a supported external provider, connects, and authorizes the connection</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can enable user authentication, Connected Accounts, or both for supported social or enterprise connections. The following table explains the behavior for the different Purpose settings, including how to pass scopes to the connection:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Authentication</strong></th>
<th><strong>Connected Accounts</strong></th>
<th><strong>Behavior</strong></th>
<th><strong>Scopes</strong></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>The connection uses the `/authorize` login flow to authenticate users as a valid identity provider.</td>
<td>Use the Auth0 Dashboard or Management API to pass the desired scopes for your connection. At runtime, this list is automatically completed with any additional scopes included in the `connection_scope` parameter of the authorization request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>The connection uses the Connected Accounts flow to retrieve and store the tokens for the connection in the Token Vault. The connection does not use the `/authorize` login flow to authenticate users, and is excluded from the list of valid identity providers.</td>

At runtime, any scopes included in the `scopes` parameter in the authorization request take precedence over the scopes selected in the Auth0 Dashboard except for `offline_access`, if required by the connection and enabled in the Auth0 Dashboard.<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> If required by the connection, Auth0 will prompt you to enable `offline_access`, allowing the client application to fetch a refresh token from Auth0. You must enable `offline_access` for the connection in the Auth0 Dashboard.</td>

## How it works

The Connected Accounts flow uses the [My Account API](/docs/manage-users/my-account-api) to create and manage connected accounts for a user across supported external providers. 

Before the user can initiate a Connected Accounts request from the client application, the client application needs to [get an access token](/docs/manage-users/my-account-api#get-an-access-token) with the Connected Accounts scopes to access the My Account API.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the end-to-end Connected Accounts flow:

<Frame>![](/docs/images/token-vault/connected_accounts_flow_diagram.png)</Frame>

When a user logs in via a supported external provider through Auth0, they initiate a Connected Accounts request from the client application:

1. The client application makes a `POST` request to the My Account API’s `/me/v1/connected-accounts` endpoint, passing scopes and other parameters to send to the external provider. To learn more, read [Initiate Connected Accounts request](#initiate-connected-accounts-request).
2. The My Account API creates a unique `auth_session` and `connect_uri` containing a `ticket` that redirects the user to a web browser. The client application saves the `auth_session` for later verification. If [DPoP](/docs/secure/sender-constraining/demonstrating-proof-of-possession-dpop) is configured, the My Account API validates the DPoP Proof JWT. 
3. The client application redirects the user to the `connect_uri` with the `ticket` as a query parameter for user authentication and authorization in the browser. The client application may also pass a `code_challenge` or `code_challenge_method` to the URL, as in the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce).
4. The user connects and authorizes the permissions for the connection in the consent screen.
5. After the user successfully authorizes the connection, the external provider redirects the user to the My Account API, which redirects the user to the client application using the `redirect_uri` with a single-use `connect_code`. 
6. The client application presents the `connect_code`, `code_verifier` (if applicable), and the original `auth_session` to the My Account API by making a `POST` request to the `/me/v1/connected-accounts/complete` endpoint. To learn more, read [Complete Connected Accounts request](#complete-connected-accounts-request). 
7. The My Account API validates the request by confirming:
    * The `auth_session` matches the ID originally issued for the user
    * The request is coming from the same device that initiated the Connected Accounts flow
    * The DPoP Proof JWT (if configured)
    * The single-use `connect_code`
    * The `code_verifier` (if using the PKCE flow)
8. After successful validation, the Auth0 Authorization Server adds the account to the `connected_accounts` array on the user profile and stores the access and refresh tokens for the connected account in the Token Vault.
9. My Account API completes the flow by sending a `200` status code back to the client application, indicating that the account was successfully connected.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Connected Accounts, make sure you:
- [Configure Token Vault](/docs/secure/tokens/token-vault/configure-token-vault) for your client application to securely store the access and refresh tokens associated with each connected account in the Token Vault.
- [Configure the My Account API](#configure-my-account-api), which is used by authenticated users to connect and manage accounts.
- [Configure Multi-Resource Refresh Token (MRRT)](#configure-multi-resource-refresh-token) to get an access token for the My Account API. 
- (Optional) [Configure DPoP](/docs/secure/sender-constraining/configure-sender-constraining) for the My Account API and your client application to sender constrain access tokens, preventing token theft. By default, the My Account API can accept DPoP-bound access tokens.

### Configure My Account API

To use Connected Accounts, configure the My Account API in the Auth0 Dashboard:
1. Navigate to **Applications > APIs** and [activate the My Account API](/docs/manage-users/my-account-api#activate-the-my-account-api).
2. Once activated, select **Auth0 My Account API** and then the **Applications** tab.
3. Toggle your client application to authorize it to access the My Account API. 
4. In the dropdown menu, select the [Connected Accounts scopes](/docs/manage-users/my-account-api#scope) for the application in the dropdown.
5. Select **Update**. This creates a [client grant](/docs/get-started/applications/application-access-to-apis-client-grants) that allows your client application to access the My Account API with the Connected Accounts scopes on the user’s behalf. 
6. If you’re using [Multi-Resource Refresh Token](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/multi-resource-refresh-token#multi-resource-refresh-token), navigate to the **Settings** tab. Under **Access Settings**, select **Allow Skipping User Consent**.

### Configure Multi-Resource Refresh Token

Configure Multi-Resource Refresh Token (MRRT) to get a single long-lived refresh token that can be exchanged for new My Account API access tokens and other APIs without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

You can configure MRRT with the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) or the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

<Tabs><Tab title="Auth0 Dashboard">

To configure MRRT with the Auth0 Dashboard:
1. Navigate to **Applications > Applications** and select your application. 
2. Under **Multi-Resource Refresh Token**, select **Edit Configuration**.
3. To enable MRRT with the My Account API, toggle on the **My Account API**.

</Tab><Tab title="Management API">

To configure MRRT for a client application, make a `PATCH` request to the `/api/v2/clients/{clientId}` endpoint and add the My Account API identifier and Connected Accounts scopes to the refresh token policies:

```bash lines
curl -X PATCH --location "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/clients/{clientId}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "is_first_party": true,
          "refresh_token": {
            "expiration_type": "non-expiring",
            "leeway": 0,
            "infinite_token_lifetime": true,
            "infinite_idle_token_lifetime": true,
            "token_lifetime": 31557600,
            "idle_token_lifetime": 2592000,
            "rotation_type": "non-rotating",
            "policies": [
              {
                "audience": "https://'"$DOMAIN"'/me/",
                "scope": [
                  "create:me:connected_accounts",
                  "read:me:connected_accounts",
                  "delete:me:connected_accounts"
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }'
```

## Configure Connected Accounts

Before configuring Connected Accounts for a connection, make sure you’ve authorized the connection for your client application. 

In the Auth0 Dashboard:
1. Navigate to **Authentication > Social Connections** or **Enterprise Connections** and select the connection.
2. Select **Applications** and then toggle on the connection for your client application.

You can configure Connected Accounts with the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) or the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2).

<Tabs><Tab title="Auth0 Dashboard">

To configure Connected Accounts with the Auth0 Dashboard:
1. Navigate to **Authentication > Social Connections** or **Enterprise Connections**.
2. Select **Create Connection** or select an existing connection.
3. In **Purpose**, toggle on **Use for Connected Accounts for Token Vault**. Depending on your **Purpose** setting, you may need to enable `offline_access` in the Auth0 Dashboard, allowing the client application to obtain a refresh token from the external provider during the Connected Accounts flow. To learn more, read [User authentication vs Connected Accounts](#user-authentication-vs-connected-accounts).
5. Click **Save**.

</Tab><Tab title="Management API">

To configure Connected Accounts with the Management API, make a `PATCH` request to the `/connections/{connectionId}` endpoint to set `connected_accounts` to `true`:

```bash lines
curl -L -X PATCH "https://{yourDomain}/api/v2/connections/{connectionId}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_TOKEN>" \
-d '{"connected_accounts":{"active":true}}'
```

</Tab></Tabs>

## Get access token for Connected Accounts

Before initiating a Connected Accounts request, [get an access token](/docs/manage-users/my-account-api#scope) for the My Account API with the Connected Accounts scopes.

The following sections explain how to use [Multi-Resource Refresh Token (MRRT)](/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/multi-resource-refresh-token) to get an access token for the My Account API.

### Fetch a refresh token

After [configuring MRRT](#configure-multi-resource-refresh-token) for the client application, initiate the authorization code flow and exchange the resulting authorization code for a refresh token.

The following is an authorization code flow request for a confidential client that includes the `offline_scope` to return a refresh token and a single-use authorization code for the My Account API identifier `https://{yourDomain}/me/`: 

```bash lines
open "https://{yourDomain}/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&response_type=code&prompt=login&scope=openid%20profile%20offline_access&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI>&state=<STATE>&audience=https://my-example-api.com"
```

Exchange the single-use authorization code for a refresh token at the `/token` endpoint:

```bash lines
curl -s --request POST \
  --url "https://{yourDomain}/oauth/token" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<EOF | jq -r '.refresh_token'
{
  "grant_type": "authorization_code",
  "code": "<CONNECT_CODE>",
  "scope": "openid profile offline_access",
  "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "audience": "https://{yourDomain}/me/",
  "redirect_uri": "<REDIRECT_URI>"
}
EOF
```

### Exchange refresh token for My Account API access token

Once you’ve obtained a refresh token, exchange it for a My Account API access token with the Connected Accounts scopes using the refresh token grant type:

```bash lines
curl -s -X POST "https://{yourDomain}/oauth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=refresh_token" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=<CLIENT_ID>" \
  --data-urlencode "client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>" \
  --data-urlencode "refresh_token=<REFRESH_TOKEN>" \
  --data-urlencode "audience=https://{yourDomain}/me/" \
  --data-urlencode "scope=openid profile offline_access create:me:connected_accounts read:me:connected_accounts delete:me:connected_accounts"
```

## Initiate Connected Accounts request

To initiate a Connected Accounts request, make a `POST` request to the My Account API’s `/me/v1/connected-accounts/connect` endpoint with the following parameters:

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">
For a Google social connection, make sure you select `offline_access` in the Auth0 Dashboard when configuring your connection. This is required for your client application to fetch a refresh token from the Auth0 Authorization Server.

## Manage Connected Accounts

To manage a user’s connected accounts, use the `/me/v1/connected-accounts` collection.

Before using the `/connected-accounts` collection, [get an access token for Connected Accounts](#get-access-token-for-connected-accounts).

### Query connected accounts connections

Make a `GET` request to the `/me/v1/connected-accounts/connections` endpoint to return a list of connections that are linked to the user profile: 

```bash lines
curl -X GET --location "https://{yourDomain}/me/v1/connected-accounts/connections" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <MY_ACCOUNT_API_TOKEN>"
```

If successful, the My Accounts API returns a response like the following:

        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.settings.readonly",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile",
        "openid"
      ],
      "created_at": "2025-10-13T21:09:04.126Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Query connected accounts for a given connection

Make a `GET` request to the `/me/v1/connected-accounts/accounts` endpoint and pass the connection name as a query parameter to return a list of connected accounts filtered by a given connection linked to a user profile:

```bash lines
curl -X GET --location "https://{yourDomain}/me/v1/connected-accounts/accounts?connection={connectionName}" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <MY_ACCOUNT_API_TOKEN>"
```

If successful, the My Accounts API returns a response like the following, filtered for `google-oauth2` connections:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "cac_6ZqSK7Kj1R8LDZJvSb1tAn",
      "connection": "google-oauth2",
      "access_type": "offline",
      "scopes": [
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.addons.execute",
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events",

### Delete connected account

Make a `DELETE` request to the `/me/v1/connected-accounts/accounts/{connectedAccountId}` endpoint to delete a connected account for a given ID:

```bash lines
curl -X DELETE --location "https://{yourDomain}/me/v1/connected-accounts/accounts/{connectedAccountId}" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <MY_ACCOUNT_API_TOKEN>"
```

When you delete a connected account, Auth0 removes the external provider’s access and refresh tokens from the Token Vault. This does not automatically revoke the external provider’s tokens, and the refresh token could still be used to obtain new access tokens. You have to manually revoke the tokens for the external provider if they have been shared or copied elsewhere.

If successful, the My Accounts API returns a response like the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```
