Use [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com) to create tickets for questions or issues. All tenant member roles can access Support Center.

If you are an existing Private Cloud customer, you need to create an Auth0 public cloud-based tenant, also known as the "Support Tenant", to log in to the Support Center. This tenant can also be used for development and test purposes at no additional cost. Please contact your Technical Account Manager or Sales Executive to associate your public cloud-based tenant to your existing Private Cloud subscription.

   1. What were you trying to do?

## Update an existing ticket

1. Go to the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com) page and select **Home**.
2. Select the ticket that you want to update by selecting its **Request Summary**.
3. Enter any additional details into the text box and then select **REPLY**.

If you are the ticket requester and the ticket is assigned to an agent but is not solved or closed, you have the option to change the status of your ticket to **Solved** by checking the **Submit as solved** box next to the **REPLY** button.

## Reopening a closed ticket

If your ticket has been closed but you'd like to continue working with Auth0 on the issue, create a new Support Center ticket. Be sure to include the reference number for the original ticket(s).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

When a case is closed, Auth0 permanently deletes all file attachments for security purposes.

</Callout>

## Manage subscription tickets

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

To manage subscription tickets, you must have the [Elevated Support Access role](/docs/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role) assigned to you.

If you are a Tenant Administrator, you can assign the Elevated Support Access role to yourself to see all tickets opened by all users on your tenants.

</Callout>

To manage subscription tickets:

1. Go to [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com)
2. Select **Tickets** from the navigation menu.
3. Switch to the **Subscription Tickets** view.
