Entities in Auth0 are tenant configuration elements such as applications, connections, rules, and API <Tooltip tip="Resource Server: Server hosting protected resources. Resource servers accept and respond to protected resource requests." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=resource+servers">resource servers</Tooltip>.

<Warning>

Entity limits are hard limits on entities that are enforced for the health of our platform; they are not a component of pricing, though they can differ for groups of pricing plans. Individual pricing plans have separate limitations, which refer to the entitlements like MAU and Enterprise Connections you receive when you subscribe to a given plan. (To learn what your pricing plan limitations are, see [Auth0 Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing/).)

## Global subscription plan limits

This section lists limits that apply to all subscription plans.

The Organizations feature is subject to the following limits:

| Entity                                   | Maximum                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Organizations per tenant                 | 100,000                                            |
| Members per organization                 | 100,000                                            |
| Connections per organization             | 10                                                 |
| Role assignments per organization member | 50                                                 |
| M2M client grants per organization       | 100 (Public Cloud)<br /><br />1000 (Private Cloud) |

Customers on Enterprise plans can request increased entity limits for Organizations per tenant and Organization members per Organization by [contacting support](https://support.auth0.com/).

These limits can be increased to 2,000,000 Organizations per tenant and 2,000,000 Organization members per Organization on public cloud. On private cloud instances, these entities are unlimited.

The Authorization Core Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature set is subject to the following limits:

| Feature              | Limit |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Roles per tenant     | 1000  |
| Scopes per API       | 1000  |
| Roles per user       | 50    |
| Permissions per user | 1000  |
| Permissions per role | 1000  |

Note that limitations on permissions per user affect those assigned directly.
Technically, a user could have more permissions than noted if the permissions
were assigned to different roles and then the roles were assigned to the user.
<Tooltip tip="Refresh Token: Token used to obtain a renewed Access Token without forcing users to log in again." cta="View Glossary" href="/docs/glossary?term=Refresh+tokens">Refresh tokens</Tooltip>
are also subject to limitation. Refresh tokens have a limit of 200 valid tokens
per user per application. If the limit is reached and a new refresh token is
created, the system revokes or deletes the oldest token for that user in the
application. Revoked tokens and expired tokens do not count against the limit.

| Token type | Per user / application |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Refresh    | 200                    |

The Forms feature is subject to the following limits:

| Feature          | Limit |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Forms per tenant | 500   |
| Flows per tenant | 500   |

## Enterprise subscription limits

| Entity                  | Maximum |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| API Resource Servers    | 100,000 |
| Applications            | 100,000 |
| Client Grants           | 100,000 |
| Application Credentials | 2,000   |

| Applications         | 100     |
| Client Grants        | 10,000  |
| Connections          | 100     |
| Rules                | 10      |
