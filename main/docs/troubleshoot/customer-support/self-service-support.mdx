**Self Service Defect Severity Levels**

Okta will assign Defects one of the four Severity Level priorities, depending upon the resulting impact caused by the Defect. Okta may re-assign a Severity Level prioritization to Customer in the trouble ticketing system, based on the descriptions below. Okta’s assignment will be consistent with the Severity Level descriptions below. Severity Level categories are as follows:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Severity Level</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 (urgent)</td>
<td>Emergency Issue; Defect resulting in full or partial system outage or a condition that makes Auth0 unusable or unavailable in production for all of Customer’s Users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 (high)</td>
<td>Significant Business Impact; Defect resulting in a condition where major functionality is impacted or significant performance degradation is experienced; issue is persistent and affects many Users and/or major functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 (normal)</td>
<td>Minor Feature / Function Issue / General Question; Defect results in a component of Auth0 not performing as expected or documented. An inquiry by Customer representatives regarding general technical issues/questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 (low)</td>
<td>Minor Problem / Enhancement Request; Information requested on Auth0 capabilities, navigation, installation, or configuration; enhancement request.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
