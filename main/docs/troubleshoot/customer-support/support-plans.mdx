**Premier Success Plans Priority Levels**

In the event that a Service-affecting issue is detected by Okta or reported by Customer, Okta shall, in its reasonable discretion, categorize the Priority Level pursuant to the criteria below.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Priority level</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A Service failure or severe degradation. Customer is unable to access any business resources.</td>
<td>Service is down and not accessible by Users; Service is slowed to such a degree that multiple Users cannot log in, resulting in consistent “page not found errors” or similar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>A partial Service failure or mild degradation. Customer is able to access some but not all business resources.</td>
<td>Customer lacks write-access to the administrative feature of the Service (excluding regularly scheduled Service upgrades); Users can access the Service, but access is slow, sometimes resulting in “page not found” messages or similar, with access functioning as expected upon page refresh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Minor Service impact. Customer is able to access almost all business resources.</td>
<td>Non-critical individual third party applications such as “personal email” are not accessible by all Users; one User is not able to access a business application; Customer is unable to successfully integrate a new business application with the Service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Customer is able to access all business resources. Service feature enhancement request or how-to/product-functionality questions.</td>
<td>How-to questions and Service feature enhancement requests.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Premier Success Plans Response Times and Support Hours**

Okta will use reasonable efforts to adhere to the following response times pursuant to the Okta Premier Success Plan indicated on the Order Form. Okta may reduce case priority to a lower Priority Level at its discretion. For clarity, Response Time refers to the period of time from when a support case has been submitted by Customer and Okta’s initial response to Customer.

If Customer selects a Priority Level 1 case priority, Customer shall remain accessible (continuous 24x7 availability) for engagement and troubleshooting with Okta support from the time the case is submitted until the issue is mitigated.
