If you have issues with an extension, we recommend you begin the troubleshooting process following one of the two alternatives:

1. Upgrade the extension, if an upgrade is possible.
2. Reinstall the extension.

To learn more about different extensions Auth0 offers, read [Auth0 Extension](/customize/extensions).

## Upgrade the Extension

We recommend always having Extensions upgraded to the latest version available.

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions).
2. On the **Installed Extensions** tab, check if there is an upgrade available for the specific extension.
3. Click the **Update to...** option.

## Reinstall the Extension

An alternative when running into issues with an extension is to reinstall it:

1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions).
2. On the **Installed Extensions** tab, delete the extension.
3. Log out of the Auth0 Dashboard.
4. Log back in to the Auth0 Dashboard.
5. Reinstall and reconfigure the extension.
