As of June 21, 2023, Auth0 will no longer support .NET and C# Node.js Extensibility features.

## Affected workflows

Review your Extensibility features for code that contains `require(edge)`.

Review the following flows or features that allow extensibility code for references to `edge.js`:

* [Hooks](/docs/customize/hooks)
* [Rules](/docs/customize/rules)
* [Custom Database Scripts](/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db/create-db-connection#create-database-action-scripts)
* [Custom Social Connections](/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/social-identity-providers/oauth2)

## Recommended updates

There is no official planned replacement for this feature.

One path for migration is to replace the `edge` logic to a separate service within your own infrastructure. After you create the service in your infrastructure, you can use an Extensibility function to make an HTTP request to trigger the required operation.

For example, in a Custom Database Login script using `edge`, remove the function that calls `edge` with a generic HTTP client to capture the response.

Another path for migration is to rewrite the Extensibility feature in JavaScript instead of .NET/C#.
