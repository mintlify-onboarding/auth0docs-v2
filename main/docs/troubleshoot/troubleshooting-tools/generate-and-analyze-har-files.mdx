A [HAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har) (HTTP Archive) file is a JSON-formatted log of a web browser's interactions with a web server.

A HAR file shows the sequence of redirects that happen during a login transaction, which makes it an excellent resource for debugging authentication issues. Including a HAR file in your [support requests](https://support.auth0.com) can help accelerate the troubleshooting process.

<Warning>

Before sharing a HAR file with anyone (including Auth0), ensure that you remove or obfuscate all sensitive data, such as:

* Confidential user information
* Personal identifiable information (PII)
* Confidential application information
