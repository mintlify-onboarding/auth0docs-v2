By using the Auth0 Organizations feature, a single Auth0 Tenant can be provisioned for deployment to a production environment. For all but the most complex architectural scenarios, provisioning of a single Auth0 Tenant for use in a production environment is recommended because it provides ease of integration/use for [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/authenticate/single-sign-on), user [Profile Management](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/profile-management), and so on. Depending on the implementation, you will need to address some additional items concerning setup of your Auth0 Tenant and your corresponding integration.

Branding associated with an organization is extremely valuable because using brand collateral provides users with an environment that they know and trust. Using recognized brand collateral also increases user confidence that the information they provide (for example, credentials) will be handled safely and securely. Default out-of-box Auth0 branding should therefore be replaced. To learn more, see [Branding](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/branding).

## Organizations

You should create an independent Auth0 Organization for each of the organizations you will support. In this case, we’ll create the `hoekstra` organization to represent Hoekstra & Associates in our example, and the `metahexa` organization to represent MetaHexa Bank. You can [create organizations](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/create-organizations) either manually via the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> or programmatically via the use of the Auth0 <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>.

## Applications

Depending on how your Organization Tenant implementation is designed, you have different options when creating [Application](/get-started/applications) definitions within your Auth0 Tenant. Whichever option you choose, the [Organization behavior is defined at the application level](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/define-organization-behavior).

If you provision a separate Organization Tenant for each of your customers, then you will typically need an independent Application definition in Auth0 for each. This arrangement will also usually involve sending both the Application-specific `client_id` parameter and the `organization` parameter, which identifies which Auth0 Organization to use, as part of the call to the `/authorize` endpoint. To learn more, see [Authentication](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/authentication).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

**Best Practice**

For ease of configuration and maximized security isolation, define Applications in Auth0 independently. Doing so allows items like allowed callback URLs to be configured independently and, following the principle of least privilege, minimizes the potential exposure of any Client ID and Client Secret information.

</Callout>

Alternatively, the use of a single Application definition in Auth0 is supported. In this case, the user will be prompted to specify the required organization as part of first-factor authentication. This will typically require the use of a common Application `client_id`, but the `organization` parameter will be omitted on the call to the `/authorize` endpoint.

## Connections

Next, define the [Connections](/authenticate/identity-providers) that will be used to authenticate users. In this case, we’ll define a [Database Connection](/authenticate/database-connections) for users associated with Hoekstra & Associates and an [Enterprise Connection](/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers) for users associated with MetaHexa Bank.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

**Best Practice**

For Single Identity Provider (IdP) Organizations, create one Connection for each defined organization in order to provide flexibility for a number of use case scenarios. For example, a single [Database or Custom Database Connection](/authenticate/database-connections) per organization allows you to easily delete users associated with organizations that get decommissioned and offers maximum flexibility for organizations that have differing requirements for password complexity.

</Callout>

Once the Connection has been defined, it can be provisioned to the appropriate Auth0 Organization using either the Auth0 Dashboard or Auth0 Management API. For more information, see [Enable Organization Connections](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/enable-connections).

## Users

For users that are authenticated via Connections other than Database or Custom Database Connections, the user is provisioned to the external <Tooltip tip="Identity Provider (IdP): Service that stores and manages digital identities." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Identity+Provider">Identity Provider</Tooltip> (IdP) independent of Auth0 and in the normal way. On the other hand, users that are authenticated via Database or Custom Database Connections can be provisioned in a number of different ways. The Auth0 Dashboard and Auth0 Management API can be used to create a user directly in your Auth0 Tenant. We also support [Automatic Migration](/manage-users/user-migration/configure-automatic-migration-from-your-database) and [Bulk Migration](/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-imports).

<Warning>

For a user to be provisioned via the Management API or the Dashboard, you must directly enable a Database or Custom Database Connection for at least one Application. Enabling a Database or Custom Database Connection for an Organization only will not suffice.

</Warning>

Users are then associated with an Auth0 Organization by assigning them memberships, and an Auth0 Organization can be configured to [assign user Membership automatically](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/grant-just-in-time-membership) or [on a manual basis](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/assign-members).

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

For a user to be manually assigned Membership to an organization, that user must already have a [User Profile](/manage-users/user-accounts/user-profiles) defined in Auth0. You can [manually assign Membership](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/assign-members) using either the Auth0 Tenant Dashboard or the Auth0 Management API.

</Callout>

### Invitation

The Auth0 Organization feature also supports the use of Member Invitation. In the Member Invitation workflow, inviting a user to an application will result in the user being provisioned automatically and their user membership being generated automatically.

#### Database Connection

Using our Hoekstra & Associates example, let’s see how this implementation might flow where a Database Connection is used as part of user invitation; most of the workflow described will typically be handled by using the relevant Auth0 SDK or library associated with your technology stack:

<Frame>![Architecture Scenarios - MOA - Isolated Users, Shared Apps, Invitation Flow (Database Connection)](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/2QMwMeBQ6U9TjLtbjPgNwe/1b436cd226b95355e73a93d5f9bc0be3/Isolated_Users__Shared_Apps__Invitation_Flow__Database_Connection_.png)</Frame>

1. Jennifer from Hoekstra & Associates receives an email sent from Travel0’s Auth0 Tenant on behalf of Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking.

   1. The email was sent as described in [Invite Organization Members](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/invite-members) and may have been triggered using either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Auth0 Management API.
2. Jennifer opens the email and clicks on its contained link. Doing so directs her browser to Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking. The base URL used in the link is specified as the [Application Login URI](/get-started/applications/application-settings), which forms part of Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking application definition in the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant.

   1. The link contains `organization` and `organization_name` parameters. The `organization` parameter is set to the ID of the corresponding Auth0 Organization definition in your Auth0 Tenant. This will be forwarded to the Auth0 Tenant as part of step 3.
   2. The link also contains the `invitation` parameter, which will also be forwarded as part of step 3.
3. Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking redirects to the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant using [Authorization Code Flow](/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow) (with or without [PKCE](/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)) by calling the `/authorize` endpoint and passing parameters similar to the following, typically via use of an [Auth0 SDK](/libraries) or third-party library:

   1. `redirect_uri`: [`https://hoekstra.corp.travel0.net/login/callback`](https://hoekstra.corp.travel0.net/login/callback)
   2. `response_type`: `code`
   3. `state`: Unique [state](/secure/attack-protection/state-parameters) generated in this session
   4. `scope`: `openid profile` ...
   5. any necessary additional [OIDC Scopes](/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes), depending on the information required about the user.
   6. `client_id`: Client ID associated with the Application created in the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant for Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking.
   7. `organization`: ID of the inviting organization typically obtained via the link in the email described in step 2. Specified in the form `organization=`organization_id, where organization_id is set to the identifier associated with the corresponding Auth0 Organization definition in your Auth0 Tenant.
   8. `invitation`: Additional `invitation` parameter associated with the link in the email, as described in step 2.
4. The Travel0 Auth0 Tenant redirects to `/signup/invitation` to collect a password credential from the user.

   1. A Universal Login Page, which you can configure to display organization-specific brand collateral as described in [Branding](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/branding), is displayed.

      <Warning>

      The invitation workflow associated with the Auth0 Organizations feature does not consider any SSO session held with Auth0. If a user is invited to sign up and they are already signed in, clicking the link in the email will always result in the display of the associated Universal Login Page.

      </Warning>
5. The user enters their password (and any additional credentials, such as user name) and clicks continue. The user ID is set to the email address associated with the user and cannot be changed.
6. The Travel0 Auth0 Tenant checks credentials. If valid, the user is provisioned and Auth0 Organization Membership is set. The user is implicitly authenticated, and the [Rules](/customize/rules) pipeline executes. Rules can be used to handle access control, as described in [Authorization](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/authorization).

   1. If credentials for the user are invalid, then the user will be prompted to re-enter them.
7. Upon successful credential checking and Rules execution, the user is redirected to the `redirect_uri` ([`https://hoekstra.corp.travel0.net/login/callback`](https://hoekstra.corp.travel0.net/login/callback)) with the `state` passed in step 3, as well as a `code`.
8. Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking validates the `state` and then calls the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant at [`https://auth.travel0.net/oauth/token`](https://auth.travel0.net/oauth/token), passing the `code` and its `client id` and `client secret` in exchange for the [ID Token](/secure/tokens/id-tokens). The ID token is then used to generate a session for [`https://hoekstra.corp.travel0.net`](https://hoekstra.corp.travel0.net).
9. Hoekstra & Associates' instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking instance displays the appropriate page to the user.

#### Enterprise Connection

Using our MetaHexa Bank example, let’s see how this implementation might flow where an Enterprise Connection is used as part of user invitation; again, most of the workflow described will typically be handled by using the relevant Auth0 SDK or library associated with your technology stack:

<Frame>![Architecture Scenarios - MOA - Isolated Users, Shared Apps, Invitation Flow (Enterprise Connection)](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/1IsdaHpprvIp17R5zYIg7q/c2c73360fb21657ab2ae98c0981b1cc6/Isolated_Users__Shared_Apps__Invitation_Flow__Enterprise_Connection_.png)</Frame>

1. Amintha from MetaHexa Bank receives an email sent from Travel0’s Auth0 Tenant on behalf of MetaHexa Bank's instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking.

   1. The email was sent as described in [Invite Organization Members](/manage-users/organizations/configure-organizations/invite-members) and may have been triggered using either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Auth0 Management API.
2. Amintha opens the email and clicks on its contained link. Doing so directs her browser to MetaHexa Bank's instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking. The base URL used in the link is specified as the [Application Login URI](/get-started/applications/application-settings), which forms part of MetaHexa Bank's instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking application definition in the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant.

   1. The link contains `organization` and `organization_name` parameters. The `organization` parameter is set to the ID of the corresponding Auth0 Organization definition in your Auth0 Tenant. This will be forwarded to the Auth0 Tenant as part of step 3.
   2. The link also contains the `invitation` parameter, which will also be forwarded as part of step 3.
3. MetaHexa Bank's instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking redirects to the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant using [Authorization Code Flow](/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow) (with or without [PKCE](/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce)) by calling the `/authorize` endpoint and passing parameters similar to the following, typically via use of an [Auth0 SDK](/libraries) or third-party library:

   1. `redirect_uri`: [`https://metahexa.corp.travel0.net/login/callback`](https://metahexa.corp.travel0.net/login/callback)
   2. `response_type`: `code`
   3. `state`: Unique [state](/secure/attack-protection/state-parameters) generated in this session
   4. `scope`: `openid profile` ...
   5. any necessary additional [OIDC Scopes](/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes), depending on the information required about the user.
   6. `client_id`: Client ID associated with the Application created in the Travel0 Auth0 Tenant for MetaHexa Bank's instance of Travel0 Corporate Booking.
   7. `organization`: ID of the inviting organization typically obtained via the link in the email described in step 2. Specified in the form `organization=`organization_id, where organization_id is set to the identifier associated with the corresponding Auth0 Organization definition in your Auth0 Tenant.
   8. `invitation`: Additional `invitation` parameter associated with the link in the email, as described in step 2.
4. The Travel0 Auth0 Tenant redirects to `/invitation`, where Amintha is informed that she will be redirected to the MetaHexa IdP to authenticate first-factor credentials.

   1. The user confirms, and
   2. Auth0 redirects to the MetaHexa Bank IdP instance, where
   3. The login page is displayed, and the user enters credentials and clicks `login`.
5. If successful, the Auth0 Organization Membership is set, the user is implicitly authenticated, and the [Rules](/customize/rules) pipeline executes. Rules can be used to handle access control as described in [Authorization](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/authorization).

Steps 6 through 8 will match those described in the [Database Connection](#database-connection) scenario, but where Amintha is the user instead of Jennifer, and where MetaHexa Bank (`metahexa.corp.travel0.net`) will be used in place of Hoekstra & Associates.

#### Social Connection

Invitation via Social Connection follows a similar pattern to that associated with an [Enterprise Connection](#enterprise-connections), but the upstream IdP is associated with the social provider rather than any specific organization. For additional considerations with respect to using Social Connections, please see [Authentication](/get-started/architecture-scenarios/multiple-organization-architecture/single-identity-provider-organizations/authentication).
