<Card title="Before you start">

You need to create a new application in Auth0 Dashboard or convert an existing application before you continue. To learn more, read [Configure Private Key JWT Authentication](/get-started/applications/configure-private-key-jwt).

</Card>

You need to complete two steps when authenticating with `private_key_jwt:`

1. Build the client assertion. This assertion is a JWT signed by the private key when you generated the key pair. To learn how to generate a key pair, read [Configure Private Key JWT Authentication](/get-started/applications/configure-private-key-jwt).
2. Use the assertion to authenticate against Auth0.

## Build the assertion

You can use one of Auth0’s SDKs to build an assertion automatically for you. If you don’t use our SDKs, you will need to construct the assertion yourself.

The assertion is a <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Token (JWT): Standard ID Token format (and often Access Token format) used to represent claims securely between two parties." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=JSON+Web+Token">JSON Web Token</Tooltip> (JWT) that should contain the following properties and claims:

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

All claims are required unless otherwise stated. To learn more about JWT claims, read [JSON Web Token Claims](/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims).

</Callout>

* Header

  + `alg`: The algorithm used to sign the assertion. The algorithm must match the algorithm specified when you created your application credential.
  + `kid`**:** (optional) The Auth0 generated `kid` of the credential. The `kid` is created when you created the credential.
* Payload

  + `iss`**:** Your application's Client ID. You can find this value in your application settings under [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/applications/) and select the **Settings** tab.
  + `sub`**:** Your application's Client ID. You also can find this value in your application settings. You can find this value in your application settings under [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/#/applications/) and select the **Settings** tab.
  + `aud`**:** The URL of the Auth0 tenant or custom domain that receives the assertion. For example: `https://{yourTenant}.auth0.com/`**.** Include the trailing slash.

    <Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

    If you have configured a custom domain for your Auth0 tenant, this can be used as the `aud` claim. We recommend using the custom domain in this case.

    </Callout>
  + `iat` (optional), `nbf` (optional), and `exp`: Issued At, Not Before, and Expiration claims set to the correct timestamps. A clock skew of up to 10 seconds is allowed for `iat` and `nbf` (if present) to support inter-operability. The client assertion is a one-time use token, and we recommend the shortest possible expiry time. Auth0 supports a maximum of 5 minutes for the lifetime of a token.
  + `jti`: A unique claim ID created by the client. We recommend using the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) format.

    <Warning>

    This JWT is a one-time use only token and should be considered as such by having a short expiry. We recommend setting a maximum of 1 minute.

    </Warning>

The token must then be signed with the private key you generated when you created or configured your application for Private Key JWT Authentication. To learn how, review the [JSON Web Token specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-7.1).

We recommend you construct the token using standard tooling or third party libraries that support this functionality out of the box, rather than implementing from scratch yourself.  To learn more about supporting libraries, read the listing at [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/libraries).

### Example

In the example below, the Node.js script uses a [jose package](https://github.com/panva/jose) to generate the assertion:

```javascript lines expandable
const { SignJWT } = require('jose')
const crypto = require("crypto");
const uuid = require("uuid");

async function main() {
 const privateKeyPEM = crypto.createPrivateKey(/**
   Read the content of your private key here. We recommend to store your private key
   in a secure infrastructure. 
 */);

 const jwt = await new SignJWT({})
   .setProtectedHeader({ 
      alg: 'RS256', // or RS384 or PS256
      kid: '(OPTIONAL) KID_GENERATED_BY_AUTH0' 
   })
   .setIssuedAt()
   .setIssuer('CLIENT_ID')
   .setSubject('CLIENT_ID')
   .setAudience('https://YOUR_TENANT.auth0.com/') // or your CUSTOM_DOMAIN
   .setExpirationTime('1m')
   .setJti(uuid.v4())
   .sign(privateKeyPEM);
  console.log(jwt)
}

main();
```






Example client assertion signed with a private key:

Corresponds to:

```json lines
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "my kid"
}
{
  "iat": 1626684584,
  "iss": "my client id",
  "sub": "my client id",
  "aud": "https://mytenant.auth0.com/",
  "exp": 1626684644,
  "jti": "e4dc8ed1-b108-4901-8bbc-c07a791817e7"
}
```






After you generate the JWT with the required information, you are ready to authenticate your application against Auth0.

## Exchange assertion for access tokens

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

The following example uses the [Client Credential Flow](/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow). Private Key JWT authentication can be used for other grant types that also allow replacing `client_secret` with `client_assertion`.

</Callout>

To exchange the JWT assertion for an <Tooltip tip="Access Token: Authorization credential, in the form of an opaque string or JWT, used to access an API." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=access+token">access token</Tooltip>, call the Authentication API [token endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#authenticate-user) with the following parameters:

* `$client_assertion`: JWT assertion
* `$resource_server_identifier`: <Tooltip tip="Resource Server: Server hosting protected resources. Resource servers accept and respond to protected resource requests." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=resource+server">resource server</Tooltip> identifier. To learn more, read [Register APIs](/get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis).

```bash lines
curl --location --request POST 'https://$tenant/oauth/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_assertion=$client_assertion' \
  --data-urlencode 'audience=$resource_server_idenifier'
```






## Supported endpoints

In addition to the [https://$tenant/oauth/token](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-token) endpoint, the following Auth0 Authentication API endpoints support `private_key_jwt` authentication for configured applications:

* [POST /oauth/revoke](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#revoke-refresh-token)
* [POST /mfa/challenge](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#challenge-request)
* [POST /passwordless/start](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-code-or-link)

## Assertion limits

The maximum length of the JWT assertion is 2048 bytes.

Claims within the assertion have the following limits:

* `iss`: 64 characters
* `sub`: 64 characters
* `jti`: 64 characters
* `alg`: 16 characters
