<Warning>

The **User Import/Export Extension** will be deprecated in September 2025. You can access the same features now available [directly in the Auth0 Management Dashboard](/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-import-export).

</Warning>

Auth0 supports importing users from external applications using custom database connections, the Auth0 <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip>, or the User Import/Export Extension.

## Automatic migrations

Auth0 supports automatic migration of users from a [custom database connection](/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db) to Auth0. This practice is sometimes known as **trickle migration** or **lazy migration**. By activating this feature, your users are:

* Moved to Auth0 the first time they log in after you set up the integration.
* Not asked to reset their password as a result of the migration.

<Card title="Availability varies by Auth0 plan">

Both your specific login implementation and your Auth0 plan or custom agreement affect whether this feature is available. To learn more, read [Pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing).

</Card>

When a user authenticates via a custom database connection marked for import to Auth0, the following process takes place:

* Auth0 authenticates migrated users against the Auth0 database.
* If the user has not been migrated, Auth0 executes your custom login script and, upon successfully log in, adds the user to the Auth0 database.
* Subsequent logins result in the user's credentials retrieved from Auth0, **NOT** your custom database.
* New users are automatically added to the Auth0 database.

## Bulk user imports with the Management API

If you already have a user database, you can use our [`/post_users_imports`](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_users_imports) Management API endpoint to populate a database connection with this information.

## Migrate users with the User Import/Export feature

The User Import/Export feature allows you to:

* Bulk import your existing database users into Auth0.
* Search for and export some (or all) of your Auth0 database users.

To use bulk import, you must be Dashboard Editor - Users or an Admin. To use bulk export, you must be Dashboard Viewer - Users, Editor - Users, or an Admin.

You can import and export user data using the [User Import/Export feature](/manage-users/user-migration/bulk-user-import-export) available on the dashboard.
