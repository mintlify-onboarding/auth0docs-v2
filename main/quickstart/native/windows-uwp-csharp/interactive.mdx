    This tutorial demonstrates how to add user login to a UWP C# application using Auth0. We recommend that you log in
        to follow this quickstart with examples configured for your account.

    <Section id={sections[0].id} title={sections[0].title} stepNumber="1">
      This tutorial and sample project have been tested with the following:

      - Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
      - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.26100.0)
      - Auth0.OidcClient.UWP 4.0.0

      <Info>
      **New to Auth?** Learn [How Auth0 works](/overview), how it [integrates with Native Applications](/architecture-scenarios/application/mobile-api) and which [protocol](/api-auth/grant/authorization-code-pkce) it uses.
      </Info>

      ### Get Your Application Keys

      When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one.
                  You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from
                  the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

      </Frame>

      <Info>
      When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the
                            **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the
                            **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
      </Info>

      You need the following information:

      - **Domain**
      - **Client ID**

      <Info>
      If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.

      ### Configure Callback URLs

      A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The
              callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the
              application and will get an error.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, you should
                      set the **Allowed Callback URLs** to
                      `https://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/mobile`.
      </Info>

      markdownlint-disable MD002 MD041

      ### Configure Logout URLs

      A logout URL is a URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the
              authorization server. This is specified in the `returnTo` query parameter. The logout URL for your
              app must be added to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log out from the
              application and will get an error.

      <Info>
      If you are following along with the sample project you downloaded from the top of this page, the
                        logout URL you need to add to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field is
                        `https://dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com/mobile`.

      ### Get Your Application Keys

      When you signed up for Auth0, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one.
                  You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from
                  the [Application Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq/applications) section in the Auth0 dashboard.

      <Info>
      When using the Default App with a Native or Single Page Application, ensure to update the
                            **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** to `None` and set the
                            **Application Type** to either `SPA` or `Native`.
      </Info>

      You need the following information:

      - **Domain**
      - **Client ID**

      <Info>
      If you download the sample from the top of this page, these details are filled out for you.

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[2].id} title={sections[2].title} stepNumber="3">
      Use the NuGet Package Manager Console (Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console) to
            install the `Auth0.OidcClient.UWP` package, running the command:

      ```
      Install-Package Auth0.OidcClient.UWP
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[3].id} title={sections[3].title} stepNumber="4">
      To integrate Auth0 login into your application, simply instantiate an instance of the `Auth0Client`
            class, configuring the Auth0 Domain and Client ID:

      ```cs lines
      // MainPage.xaml.cs

      using Auth0.OidcClient;

      var client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions
      {
          Domain = "dev-gja8kxz4ndtex3rq.us.auth0.com",
          ClientId = "mz9iNEIo2PHu7oeh8QRt19ndTyyCIgai"
      });
      ```


      You can then call the `LoginAsync` method to log the user in:

      ```cs lines
      var loginResult = await client.LoginAsync();
      ```

      <Frame>
        <img src="https://cdn2.auth0.com/docs/1.14546.0/media/articles/native-platforms/windows-uwp-csharp/universal-login.png" />
      </Frame>

      This loads the Auth0 login page into a web view. You can learn how to customize the login page at [this document](/universal-login#simple-customization).
    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[4].id} title={sections[4].title} stepNumber="5">
      The returned login result indicates whether authentication was successful, and if so contains the tokens and
            claims of the user.

      ### Authentication Error

      You can check the `IsError` property of the result to see whether the login has failed. The
            `ErrorMessage` contains more information regarding the error which occurred.

      ```cs lines
      if (loginResult.IsError)
      {
          Debug.WriteLine($"An error occurred during login: {loginResult.Error}")
      }
      ```


      ### Accessing the tokens

      On successful login, the login result contains the ID Token and Access Token in the `IdentityToken`
            and `AccessToken` properties respectively.

      ```cs lines
      if (!loginResult.IsError)
      {
          Debug.WriteLine($"id_token: {loginResult.IdentityToken}");
          Debug.WriteLine($"access_token: {loginResult.AccessToken}");
      }
      ```


      ### Obtaining the User Information

      On successful login, the login result contains the user information in the `User` property, which is a
            [ClaimsPrincipal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal(v=vs.110).aspx).

      To obtain information about the user, you can query the claims. You can for example obtain the user's name and
            email address from the `name` and `email` claims:

      ```cs lines
      if (!loginResult.IsError)
      {
          Debug.WriteLine($"name: {loginResult.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "name")?.Value}");
          Debug.WriteLine($"email: {loginResult.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "email")?.Value}");
      }
      ```


      <Info>
      The exact claims returned depends on the scopes that were requested. For more information see @scopes.
      </Info>

      You can obtain a list of all the claims contained in the ID Token by iterating through the `Claims`
            collection:

      ```cs lines
      if (!loginResult.IsError)
      {
          foreach (var claim in loginResult.User.Claims)
          {
              Debug.WriteLine($"{claim.Type} = {claim.Value}");
          }
      }
      ```

    </Section>

    <Section id={sections[5].id} title={sections[5].title} stepNumber="6">
      To log the user out call the `LogoutAsync` method.

      ```cs lines
      await client.LogoutAsync();
      ```

    </Section>
    ## Next Steps

    Excellent work! If you made it this far, you should now have login, logout, and user profile information running in your application.
