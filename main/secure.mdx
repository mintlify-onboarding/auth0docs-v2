Auth0 provides critical tools for securing your applications against people who are interested in attacking information technology systems. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) reduces risk by requiring more than one type of user validation, while attack protection features automatically detect and respond to malicious behavior such as rapid, repeated failed logins or one IP address rapidly attempting to log into multiple accounts.

Auth0 maintains and meets the requirements for multiple compliance frameworks and certifications including GDPR and HIPAA.
