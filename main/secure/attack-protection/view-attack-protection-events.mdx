Your tenant logs contain useful data that you can use to build charts to look at the profile of the traffic going through your tenant. This is helpful when evaluating <Tooltip tip="Attack Protection: Features that Auth0 provides to detect and mitigate attacks, including brute-force protection, suspicious IP throttling, breached password detection, bot detection, and adaptive multi-factor authentication." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=attack+protection">attack protection</Tooltip> activity. For example, you can look for the following events to determine if you're under attack:

* Abnormal bursts in traffic to the login flow that result in errors (such as wrong username or password errors).
* Abnormal bursts in traffic coming from IP locales that are not expected.

These events tend to happen without much change to the rate of successful logins.

You can use your tenant log data `event` field to view tenant traffic data. We recommend building a daily histogram of failure events of the following types:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Event Code</strong></th>
<th><strong>Event</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>Failed login</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fcoa</code></td>
<td>Failed cross-origin authentication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>feccft</code></td>
<td>Failed exchange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fepft</code></td>
<td>Failed exchange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fsa</code></td>
<td>Failed silent authentication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fu</code></td>
<td>Failed login (invalid email/username)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pla</code></td>
<td>Pre-login assessment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>sepft</code></td>
<td>Success exchange</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These failure events depend on the flow you have set up with Auth0.

The following example shows a credential stuffing attack on 02/13, with a large surge of events of type `fu` which is a failed username (typical of a credential stuffing attack).

## Rate of errors in login flow

Look for a surge or an abnormal number of errors for incorrect username or password. For example: Do you expect >30,000 errors per hour?

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Event Code</th>
<th>Event</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>s</code></td>
<td>Login success</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fu</code></td>
<td>Failed login, invalid email/username</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>fp</code></td>
<td>Failed login, incorrect password</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here's an example of what the data might look like.

## Rate of attack protection events

Look for abnormally high traffic for attack protection events such as <Tooltip tip="Breached Password Detection: Form of attack protection in which Auth0 notifies your users if they use a username/password combination that has been compromised in a data leak on a third-party website or app." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=breached+password+detection">breached password detection</Tooltip> or brute-force attacks for multiple accounts.

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Event Code</th>
<th>Event</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>limit_mu</code></td>
<td>Blocked IP address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>limit_wc</code></td>
<td>Blocked account</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pwd_leak</code></td>
<td>Breached password during login</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>signup_pwd_leak</code></td>
<td>Breached password during signup</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>reset_pwd_leak</code></td>
<td>Breached password during password recovery</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here's an example of what the data might look like.

## Number of IPs producing errors and their locations

Look for a high number of IPs from locales that do not make sense. For example: Do you expect traffic from 10,000 IPs from Russia every day? Observe `ip` address data in conjunction with `fu` event traffic to determine where the failure traffic is coming from.

IP geolocation data isn't available in the tenant logs unless you're able to enrich it from another location. The IP locale is only available from Kibana where the logs are already enriched with the information.
