Auth0 supports a variety of factors for securing user access with [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors). Using `post-login` Actions, you can customize your <Tooltip tip="Multi-factor authentication (MFA): User authentication process that uses a factor in addition to username and password such as a code via SMS." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=MFA">MFA</Tooltip> flows to challenge users with a specific factor or sequence of factors. You can also use contextual information about users and their organizations to create more individualized experiences. For example, you can customize your flows to challenge users with specific factors based on their membership in certain Organizations or their assigned user roles.

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

* This feature allows you to customize your MFA selection flows. If you want to customize your MFA enrollment flows, review [Customize MFA Enrollments in Universal Login](/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa/customize-mfa-enrollments-universal-login).
* You can only customize MFA flows with Actions if you are using [Universal Login](/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login/universal-login-vs-classic-login/universal-experience).
* Some methods detailed can only be used on Universal Login and not Classic Login. For more information, read [Customize MFA for Classic Login](/secure/multi-factor-authentication/customize-mfa/customize-mfa-classic-login).

</Callout>

## How it works

You can use [Actions](/customize/actions) to customize your MFA flows. Specifically, you can modify the `post-login` trigger of the [Login Flow](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger) with the following Authentication API methods:

* `challengeWith`: Specifies the factor or factors users must use to authenticate, such as a one-time password (OTP). This method presents a default challenge to users and can optionally provide access to a factor picker that allows them to choose a different authentication method.
* `challengeWithAny`: Sets a group of factors users can choose from when authenticating, such as email and OTP. By default, this method presents a factor picker to users rather than a specific challenge, in accordance with the following conditions:

  + If two or more factors are specified, a factor picker displays to the user.
  + If the user has only enrolled in one of the specified factors (or only one factor is supplied), the factor picker is skipped.
  + If the user has not enrolled in any of the specified factors, the command fails.

You can use a combination of these methods to tailor your MFA flows as needed. You can also incorporate user metadata, such as roles or previously used factors, into these methods to create more tailored flows.

When choosing MFA challenges for your commands, you can use the factors listed below or the `enrolledFactors` value. `enrolledFactors` represents the list of active factors associated with a user's account.

* `otp`
* `email`
* `push-notification`

  + `otpFallback`
* `phone`

  + `preferredMethod: voice`
  + `preferredMethod: sms`
  + `preferredMethod: both`
* `webauthn-platform`
* `webauthn-roaming`

The array `event.authentication.methods` includes a `type` field when the name of the method is set to `mfa`. type is a string that contains factor values matching those used by the `type` field from `enrolledFactors` (listed above). When an MFA challenge is performed, `methods` contains an object of `name:mfa` with `type` set to the factor used for that challenge. `methods` is only updated when an Action begins. To see the results of a challenge, `methods` must be accessed in the next Action in the flow.

To learn more, review the following resources:

* [Actions Triggers: post-login - Event Object](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-event-object)
* [Actions Triggers: post-login - API Object](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-api-object)

### Sequenced and contextual flows

With the `challengeWith` or `challengeWithAny` commands, you can use contextual information to determine the best challenge or series of challenges to present to users. Specifically, you can leverage the following:

* **Sequenced flows**: Challenge users with a series of different factors in a specific order.
* **Contextual flows**: Determine which factor to next challenge the user with based on previous challenges in the flow.

To help illustrate these flows, consider the following example:

```javascript lines
// ACTION 1 

exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {

   api.authentication.challengeWithAny([{ type: 'phone'}, { type: 'push-notification' }]);

} 

// ============================================ 

// ACTION 2 

// Decide based on what the user did in the previous action 

exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => { 

    if(event.authentication.methods.find(m => m.type === 'phone') && event.authorization?.roles.includes('admin')) { 

        api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: 'push-notification' }); 

    }

}
```

In this scenario, a user is first challenged with SMS via the `challengeWithAny` command in Action 1. Then, Action 2 challenges the user with a push notification because they have the Admin user role and also completed the SMS challenge.

In this flow, you can make decisions about which factor to challenge the user with due to the following:

1. The flow pauses after executing Action 1.
2. The user completes the MFA flow prompted by Action 1.
3. `event.authentication.methods.type` in Action 2 populates with information from the previous MFA challenge.
4. The flow resumes to execute Action 2 using contextual information from Action 1.

While this example presents a similar experience to using redirects in your Actions, commands using `challengeWith` and `challengeWithAny` offer the following unique benefits:

* Flows pause after each command, allowing you to accumulate user information that can be used in subsequent Actions. Comparatively, redirects only occur a single time as the final command in a flow.
* MFA is triggered after each Action containing `challengeWith` or `challengeWithAny` commands is executed. With redirects, MFA runs as the final Action in the pipeline.

**Note**: This method of executing Actions only applies to those containing `challengeWith` or `challengeWithAny` commands. Actions serving other purposes are not affected.

## Before you begin

Before you can customize your MFA flows, you must first enable MFA in your tenant and prompt your users to enroll in the appropriate factors.

### Prepare your tenant

To get started, set up MFA in your tenant and enable the Customize MFA Factors using Actions setting. You can set up one or more factors and define your MFA policies on the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip> under [Security > Multifactor Auth](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/mfa).

* To learn more about the setup process, review [Enable Multi-Factor Authentication](/secure/multi-factor-authentication/enable-mfa).
* For information about configuring specific factors, review [Multi-factor Authentication Factors](/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors).

To customize your flows, you **must enable** the Customize MFA Factors using Actions toggle in the Additional Settings section. Your customized flows will not work properly if this setting is not enabled.

<Frame>![Auth0 Dashboard > Security > Multi-factor Auth > Additional Settings](/images/cdy7uua7fh8z/2hv0ELTkkka3t230SXfxw/46def5395652b2451cfc9e0ad01a371a/MFA_actions.png)</Frame>

<Callout icon="file-lines" color="#0EA5E9" iconType="regular">

* Actions invoking `challengeWith` and `challengeWithAny` commands override any challenges enabled via[api.multifactor.enable](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-api-object). They also take precedence over the MFA settings available under **Define Policies**.
* To ensure users complete MFA when attempting to access your application, set the **Require Multi-factor Auth** setting to either **Use Adaptive MFA** or **Always**. In the event your Actions code does not run, this setting serves as a backup and prevent users from bypassing MFA.
* If you wish to use risk assessors in your commands, enable the **Adaptive MFA Risk Assessment** toggle and use [event.authentication.riskAssessment](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-api-object) in your `post-login` Actions code.

</Callout>

### Enroll users in factors

Once MFA is configured, ensure your users enroll in one or more of the factors you enabled. Users must enroll in authenticators before they can be challenged by `post-login` Action commands.

After a user signs up or is created in your tenant, you can create enrollments with the <Tooltip tip="Management API: A product to allow customers to perform administrative tasks." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Management+API">Management API</Tooltip> [authentication-methods](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/post-authentication-methods) endpoint, or you can manage users' enrollments directly through their profile pages in the Auth0 Dashboard.

## Customize your MFA flows

Once your tenant is ready, you can create `post-login` Actions to customize your MFA flows. Steps and example use cases are provided below.

<Warning>

Actions (or series of Actions) in a tenant can only execute **four** of the following commands per user flow:

* `enrollWith`
* `enrollWithAny`
* `challengeWith`
* `challengeWithAny`

If this limit is exceeded (i.e., a fifth command of this type attempts to execute), an authentication error will occur.

</Warning>

### Create your post-login Action

1. On your Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to [Actions > Flows](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/flows) and select **Login**.
2. Under Add Action, select **Custom** and choose **Create Action**.
3. On the Create Action popup:

   * Enter a name for your Action.
   * Select **Login / Post-Login** as the trigger.
   * Use **Node 22 (Recommended)** for the runtime.
4. Review the popup to ensure accuracy. Then, select **Create**.
5. After creation, the code editor displays the `onPostExecute` command. Add your custom code or code sample to the command.
6. When your command is ready, select **Deploy**.
7. Select **Add to Flow** on the successful deployment notification.

   * **Note**: If the notification has closed, choose **Back to Flow** above the code editor.
8. Drag and drop your new command from the Add Action panel into your Login flow. Then, select **Apply**.

To make additional updates to your Action, navigate to [Actions > Library > Custom](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/library) and select your command. You can then update and redeploy your code as needed.

<Warning>

When adding a redirect to your MFA flow, ensure your Action meets the following conditions to prevent users from skipping or bypassing MFA:

* The redirect (`sendUserTo`) command must be in a separate Action from your MFA commands.
* The redirect Action must be the last Action executed in your flow.

For more information about redirects, review [Redirect with Actions](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/redirect-with-actions).

</Warning>

### Test your post-login Action

To ensure your commands function appropriately, you can test your Action through the Auth0 Dashboard:

* Navigate to [Authentication > Authentication Profile](https://manage.auth0.com/#/authentication-profiles).
* Select **Try** to open a sample login prompt in a new tab.
* Enter your credentials and test your new MFA flow.

If the flow is successful, a confirmation screen displays. If you encounter any issues, you can update your code by navigating to [Actions > Library > Custom](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/library) on your Auth0 Dashboard.

## Example use cases

The examples below outline common use cases for customizing MFA flows.

### Use current enrollments to determine challenge method

The following sample challenges a user with MFA if they are enrolled with the following factors:

* One-time password (OTP)
* Phone

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {

 api.authentication.challengeWithAny([{type: 'otp'}, {type: 'phone'}]);

}
```






### Use roles to determine challenge method

The following sample challenges all users with OTP. If a user has the Admin role and requires a higher level of access to your application, they are challenged with an additional factor as a form of [step-up authentication](/secure/multi-factor-authentication/step-up-authentication).

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
    api.authentication.challengeWith({type: 'otp'});

    const isAdmin = event.authorization?.roles.includes('admin');
    if(isAdmin) {
        api.authentication.challengeWith({type: 'phone'});
    }
}
```






### Use metadata to determine challenge method

In this example, MFA factors are enabled at the [Organization](/manage-users/organizations) level. This sample uses different categories of metadata to determine the right challenge for individual users:

* **Organization metadata**: Organization-level data, such as the specific factors enabled for an Organization.
* **User metadata**: User-level data, such as whether a user has a phone number associated with their profile.

```js lines expandable
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const orgFactors = event.organization?.metadata.factors.split(',') ?? [];

  // Get the intersection of factors available for the user and factors enabled for the org
  const availableFactors = orgFactors.filter(f => event.user?.enrolledFactors?.some(ef => ef.type === f));

  // Prefer push if available
  if(availableFactors.includes('push-notification')) {
    api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: 'push-notification' });
    return;
  }

  // If the user has a verified phone number and the organization
  // allows for SMS and email, prefer SMS and allow email as a fallback
  // if available
  if(event.user.phone_number && 
     event.user.phone_verified && 
     availableFactors.includes('phone')) {
    if(availableFactors.includes('email')) {
      api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: 'phone' }, {
        additionalFactors: [{
          type: 'email'
        }]
      });
    } else {
      api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: 'phone' });
    }

    return;
  }

  // If push-notifications and/or phone couldn't be prioritized, fallback to email if
  // enabled for the org, otherwise fail.
  if(availableFactors.includes('email')) {
    api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: "email" });
    return;
  }

  api.access.deny("No MFA factors available for this org + user");
};
```






### Allow users to select an alternate method of authentication

For a more flexible experience, you can present users with a **Try Another Method** link as part of their MFA challenge. This link allows users to select a different method of authentication than the default challenge.

To achieve this, include the `additionalFactors` parameter in your Actions code. You can set this parameter to a specific factor for all users or use `enrolledFactors` to let users choose their preferred factor.

**Specific Factor**

The following sample challenges users with OTP by default. If desired, users can access the Try Another Method link to authenticate with email instead.

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: 'otp' }, 
    { additionalFactors: [{type: 'email'}] })
};
```






**Enrolled Factors**

The following sample challenges users with OTP by default. If desired, users can access the Try Another Method link to authenticate with one of their other enrolled factors.

```js lines
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const enrolledFactors = event.user.enrolledFactors.map((f) => ({type: f.type}));

  api.authentication.challengeWith({ type: 'otp' }, 
    { additionalFactors: enrolledFactors })
};
```






### Use Adaptive MFA to determine when to challenge users

The following example uses [Adaptive MFA](/get-started/auth0-teams/tenant-management) to determine if users should be challenged.

<Tooltip tip="Adaptive Multi-factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) that is only triggered for users when an attempted login is determined to be a low confidence login." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Adaptive+MFA">Adaptive MFA</Tooltip> is a flexible MFA policy that protects your tenant from <Tooltip tip="Adaptive Multi-factor Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) that is only triggered for users when an attempted login is determined to be a low confidence login." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=bad+actors">bad actors</Tooltip> by assessing potential risk during login transactions and prompting users for additional verification when appropriate.

In this case, users are prompted with MFA if they log in from an unrecognized device and their overall confidence score is low or medium.

```javascript lines expandable
/**
* Handler that will be called during the execution of a PostLogin flow.
*
* @param {Event} event - Details about the user and the context in which they are logging in.
* @param {PostLoginAPI} api - Interface whose methods can be used to change the behavior of the login.
*/
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  if (event.authentication?.riskAssessment?.assessments.NewDevice) {

  // Example condition: prompt MFA only based on the NewDevice 
    // confidence level, this will prompt for MFA when a user is logging in 
    // from an unknown device.
    let shouldPromptMfa;

    switch (event.authentication.riskAssessment.assessments.NewDevice.confidence) {
      case 'low':
      case 'medium':
        shouldPromptMfa = true;
        break;
      case 'high':
        shouldPromptMfa = false;
        break;
      case 'neutral':
        // When this assessor has no useful information about the confidence, 
        // do not prompt MFA.
        shouldPromptMfa = false;
        break;
    }

      // It only makes sense to prompt for MFA when the user has at least one 
      // enrolled MFA factor.
    const canPromptMfa = event.user.enrolledFactors?.length > 0;

    if (shouldPromptMfa && canPromptMfa) {
      const enrolledFactors = event.user.enrolledFactors.map((f) => ({type: f.type}));
      api.authentication.challengeWithAny(enrolledFactors);
    }

  }

};
```






### Use Actions to challenge users

You can use Actions to customize MFA flows by modifying the `post-login` trigger of theLogin Flow. This example uses the `phone` method of authentication and `preferredMethod: 'both'`, referring to the active MFA factors associated with a user's account. For more information, refer to [Actions Triggers: post-login - Event Object](/customize/actions/explore-triggers/signup-and-login-triggers/login-trigger/post-login-event-object).

```js lines
api.authentication.challengeWith({ 
  type: 'phone', 
  options: { preferredMethod: 'both'} 
});
```






## Troubleshooting

In the event that you experience errors or unexpected results from your customized MFA flows, you can use the information below to help identify and resolve these issues.

### Tenant logs

You can monitor your customized MFA flows through [tenant logs](/deploy-monitor/logs).

Tenant logs are available on the Auth0 Dashboard under [Monitoring > Logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs). Alternatively, you can retrieve logs using the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/introduction).

If you or your users experience unexpected behavior, review tenant logs for the following event codes for more information:

<table class="table"><thead>
<tr>
<th>Scenario</th>
<th>Event Code</th>
<th>Descriptive Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A user is prompted with multi-factor authentication, but none of the requested factors can be used as a challenge. In this case, the user cannot complete MFA.</td>
<td>mfar</td>
<td>This scenario results in the following error message:<br/><br/>An MFA challenge is used in a PostLogin action but the requested factors are not properly set up. To perform MFA, enable the requested factors and ensure the user is enrolled with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A user is prompted with multi-factor authentication, but one of the requested factors cannot be used as a challenge. In this case, the user can complete MFA using a different requested factor.</td>
<td>w</td>
<td>This scenario results in the following warning message:<br/><br/>An MFA challenge is used in a PostLogin action, but the requested factor \{factor name} is not properly set up. Enable the requested factor and ensure the user is enrolled with it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Troubleshooting checklist

The following checklist provides additional suggestions for identifying and resolving common issues with customized MFA flows.

1. The **Customize MFA factors with Actions** toggle must be enabled.

   * Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Security > Multi-factor Auth](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/mfa) and ensure the toggle in the Additional Settings section is enabled.
2. Factors referenced in your Actions must be enabled in your tenant.

   * **Review your code**: Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Actions > Library > Custom](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/library) and review your Actions code. Ensure all factors referenced are applicable to your use cases.
   * **Review your factors**: Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Security > Multi-factor Auth](https://manage.auth0.com/#/security/mfa) and ensure all factors referenced in your Actions are enabled.
3. Users must be enrolled in the factors referenced in your Actions.

   * If an individual receives an error, review their user details to ensure they are enrolled in the proper factors. Navigate to [**Auth0 Dashboard > User Management > Users**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/users) and select their name from the list.

     + Review the Multi-factor Authentication section on the **Detail tab** to verify their enrollments. If the user is not enrolled, you can use the **Send an enrollment invitation** link available in this section.
     + Alternatively, verify the user's enrollments through the **Raw JSON tab**. This information can also be retrieved using the [Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/get-authentication-methods). However, it is important to note that the API does not list auto-enrolled authenticators, such as Email factors set up via an email verification link.
   * If users are not enrolled in the appropriate factors, you can create enrollments with the Management API [authentication-methods](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/post-authentication-methods) endpoint. You can also manage users' enrollments directly through their profile pages in the Auth0 Dashboard.
4. Ensure your Actions have been deployed and saved in your Pipeline.

   * Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Actions > Library > Custom](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/library). Locate your Action in the list and ensure its status is **Deployed**. If a different status is listed, access your Action, review your code, and click **Deploy** to the top right.
   * Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Actions > Library > Flows](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/flows) and select **Login**. Ensure your Action is listed in the flow. If not, access the **Custom tab** of the Add Action panel and drag and drop your Action into your Login flow. Then, select **Apply**.
5. Ensure you've upgraded to the latest version of `post-login` Actions.

   * Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Actions > Library > Custom](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/library) and select your Action. If your Action is out-of-date, you will see a yellow banner prompting you to update the Action. If the banner displays, select **Update**.
   * You can also specify the latest version of `post-login` Actions for deployment when using the Deploy CLI. For more information, review [Configure the Deploy CLI](/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool/configure-the-deploy-cli).
