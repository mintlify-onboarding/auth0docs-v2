You can delete your Auth0 tenant or reset it to the default configuration in the <Tooltip tip="Auth0 Dashboard: Auth0's main product to configure your services." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=Auth0+Dashboard">Auth0 Dashboard</Tooltip>. You can delete your Auth0 account data with assistance from Auth0 Support.

## Delete tenant

<Warning>

Deleting a tenant is an irreversible, destructive action and cannot be undone. Deleted tenants cannot be restored, the tenant name cannot be reused when creating a new tenant, and metrics related to the tenant are lost.

</Warning>

Before you delete a tenant, consider the following options:

* [Change tenant ownership](/get-started/manage-dashboard-access).
* [Reset tenant configuration](#reset-tenant-configuration).

### Remove custom domain

If you configured a <Tooltip tip="Custom Domain: Third-party domain with a specialized, or vanity, name." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=custom+domain">custom domain</Tooltip> for a tenant you'd like to delete, you need to remove the custom domain first. If you do not, you cannot configure the custom domain for another tenant.

### Determine deletion process

The process for deleting a tenant depends on the [subscription plan](https://www.auth0.com/pricing) it's associated with and the [type of tenant](/get-started/auth0-overview/create-tenants/child-tenants) it is (main or child). You may be able to delete the tenant in the [Auth0 Dashboard](#delete-tenant-in-auth0-dashboard), or you may need to [contact Auth0 Support or Community](#contact-auth0-support-or-community).

### Downgrade tenant

Before you can delete a tenant in the Dashboard, you must downgrade it to the Free plan. To learn more, read [Downgrade or Cancel Auth0 Subscriptions](/troubleshoot/customer-support/manage-subscriptions/downgrade-or-cancel-subscriptions).

### Delete tenant in Dashboard

You can delete a tenant in the Dashboard if you have the [appropriate level of access](/get-started/manage-dashboard-access/feature-access-by-role).

1. Go to [Dashboard > Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/tenant/advanced), and then switch to the **Advanced** view.
2. Locate **Danger Zone** at the bottom of the page, and then select **Delete**.
3. Review the confirmation prompt and confirm that you want to permanently delete your tenant.
4. Select **Yes, Delete Tenant**.

### Contact Auth0 Support or Community

If your tenant is on a Trial, Essential, Professional, or Enterprise plan and you cannot delete your tenant in the Auth0 Dashboard, [open a ticket with Auth0 Support](/troubleshoot/customer-support/open-and-manage-support-tickets) for assistance.

If your tenant is on a Free plan and you cannot delete it in the Auth0 Dashboard, [post in Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com/) and ask for assistance.

## Reset tenant configuration

You can reset your tenant to its default configuration with the [Auth0 Deploy CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-deploy-cli).

The Deploy CLI is a tool that helps you manage your Auth0 tenant configuration. It integrates into your development workflows as a standalone CLI or as a node module. To learn more about the Deploy CLI tool and how to get started, read [Deploy CLI Tool](/deploy-monitor/deploy-cli-tool).
