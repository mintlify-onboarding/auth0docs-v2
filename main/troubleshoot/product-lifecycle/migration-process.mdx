To keep our platform stable and secure, we must occasionally modify or remove features or behaviors. These changes will sometimes result in a breaking change.

When we must introduce a breaking change, we first deprecate the affected feature or behavior and announce the deprecation to our customers. When a new Deprecation is announced, customers should engage in a migration to move away from the deprecated feature or behavior.

## End of life announcement

When we announce a Deprecation, we typically include the date that the feature or behavior will be moved into the End of Life <Tooltip tip="Product Release Stages: Phases that describe how Auth0 stages, releases, and retires product functionality." cta="View Glossary" href="/glossary?term=product+release+stage">product release stage</Tooltip> and removed from the platform. In some cases, we will immediately deprecate a feature to prevent further adoption and will determine the end of life date at a later time. End of life dates can vary between plan types.

## Migration window

When we make an end of life announcement, we will also open a migration window to allow customers to prepare for the end of life date.

Whenever possible, we provide at least a six-month migration window between the end of life announcement and the end of life date. In case of emergency (for example, critical vulnerabilities that require remediation or changes required by applicable law or third-party certification standards), we may accelerate this time frame. In such cases, we will provide as much prior notice as is reasonable under the circumstances.

## Migration guides

Auth0 deprecations usually involve replacing deprecated behavior with substantially comparable functionality (although at times, we may elect to discontinue support for some functionality entirely).

To help you migrate to the new functionality and determine the impact on your tenants, we will publish a migration guide, which will detail any necessary modifications to your application's code, inform you of any other required actions, and instruct you about how you opt in to the new behavior prior to the End of Life date.

Once the end of life date is reached, the new behavior will automatically be enabled for tenants that did not opt in during the migration window.
